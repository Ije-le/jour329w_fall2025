EMBEDDINGS TASK

The dots in the visualization are grouped by the content of the stories. Dots where the stories talk about similar things are closer to each other than stories talking about different topics. For instance, I found a story focused on Cherry Blossoms sitting right next to another talking about Halloween. I found the connection between both stories to be plants, because the Halloween story talked a lot about pumpkin spices and other leaves. That was also close to another story talking about wild orchids, so I can tell that these stories are related by their focus on plants.
A much bigger cluster focuses stories about road traffic in Maryland: a story on a road traffic crash was next to another on the projected number of maryland residents expected to hit the road for Thanksgiving which was also close to aniother about an initiative in Montgomery County that is helping to drop the rate of fatal crashes in the county.
A smaller cluster close to the label "federal-government-said-WASHINGTON" had stories on the federal government's intention to move the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, Maryland.
While these groupings give some insight into CNS' news coverage, better labelling of these groupings would have helped much better. The cluster of road crashes stories was labelled "Maryland-said-health-state" which didn't do much to provide context. A better description for this cluster could have been "Traffic" or something more related.
