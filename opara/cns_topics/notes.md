## CNS Topic Analysis 10/01/2025

A topic that seems too broad is..

Some topics did seem to overlap and could have been merged to [still give the same effect]
Examples are Commerce, Trade. Although "Trade" seemed to be used more in terms of international activities, I think both topics still had areas of overlap and could have been compressed in one.
Another example is "Federal government and politics" and "Maryland government and politics". While I understand that one focuses on state while the other focuses on the federal governnment, I feel that these could have fallen under the topic "politics". 

A Maryland-specific topic that I think is important and csn be added to the list is drug use. There were some stories on cannabis data, driving under its influence and the business side of it.
