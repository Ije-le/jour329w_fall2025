## CNS Topic Analysis 10/01/2025

A Maryland-specific topic that I think is important and can be added to the list is drug use. There were some stories on cannabis data, driving under its influence and the business side of it.

1. Agriculture and Food: Frequent coverage by CNS and I wouldn't think of this as a topic, but it totally aligns with CNS' coverage of food and agriculture, so I will keep it.
2. Animals: A weird topic to me, but CNS does cover a lot about pets and animals, and given the premium that people place on their pets in this society, I'll say this is a valid topic.
3. Armed Forces and National Security
4. Arts & Culture
5. Civil Rights
6. Commerce: Focuses on more local issues, but I feel it can be merged with Trade
7. Congress: I might consider putting this under a 'Politics' topic, but that might get to broad, so I'll leave as is.
8. Justice: Would merge this with "Law"
9. Budget
10. Education: Clear, frequesnt coverage
11. Elections: Clear definition, frequent coverage.
12. Emergency Management
13. Energy
14. Environmental Protection
15. Families
16. Economy
17. Trade: Stories under this seem to focus on international issues, but could be paired with Commerce
18. Maryland Government and Politics: Though focused on state politics, could have been merged with "Federal Government and Politics" under one header: Politics.
19. Federal Government and Politics: Though focused on federal politics, could have been merged with "Maryland Government and Politics" under one "politics" header.
20. Health: An important topic, many stories on the website fall under this category.
21. Housing: Also very important, relevant and frequently covered on CNS website.
22. Immigration: Clear definition, frequent coverage
23. International Affairs
24. Labor and Employment
25. Law: This would come under "Law & Justice topic"
26. Native Americans: Might place this under Civil Rights
27. Natural Resources
28. Science & Technology
29. History
30. Social Welfare
31. Sports: Clear definition, very frequent coverage.
32. Taxes
33. Transportation and Public Works
34. Chesapeake Bay
35. Baltimore: Clear definition, very frequent coverage. I still haven't figured out why one county/city is a beat in most newsrooms, but it is frequently covered by CNS so it was as a topic.

Description and explanation of updated topics:
Trade & Commerce: This topic is a merger of two topics that stood alone: Trade, Commerce. While stories under 'Trade' focus on international stories and Commerce is more local, some of the stories on international trade by CNS also highlighted local impact which allows for an intersection of both topics.
Law & Justice: This combined thee topics "Law" and "Justice" into one. They also seemed to have court proceedings in common.
Politics: I created this topic by merging "Federal government and politics" and "Maryland government and politics". While I understand that one focuses on state while the other focuses on the federal governnment, I feel that these could have fallen under the topic "politics." The kind of issues reported on CNS about the federal govt and Maryland govt seemed to overlap. 
Native Americans: I took this out totally because based on CNS' coverage of issues affecting Native Americans, the Civil Rights topic could have still worked well for this.
