# Baltimore: A Journalist's Guide to a City at a Crossroads

Welcome to Baltimore reporting. This guide draws from recent coverage to help you understand the key issues shaping the city right now, the people driving change, and where the real stories are heading. Think of it less as a historical overview and more as a working map for what matters today and tomorrow.

## The Immediate Landscape

Baltimore is a city of sharp contradictions that make for compelling reporting. The most recent coverage shows a place experiencing genuine momentum on violence reduction—homicides hit historic lows in 2024—while simultaneously facing institutional uncertainty and federal budget pressures that could undo those gains. This tension between progress and fragility should anchor your thinking about the city.

Two major developments frame the current moment. First, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in March 2024 was an infrastructure shock that could have devastated the economy. Instead, the city's rapid response and community resilience actually demonstrated something worth exploring: how federal intervention, state support, and local networks can work together. Second, the Trump administration's budget cuts to violence prevention programs in 2025 represent a real threat to the gains made in recent years. Understanding both teaches you something essential about Baltimore's vulnerabilities.

## Violence Prevention: The Story That Matters Most

Safe Streets and the broader violence intervention ecosystem represent the most important ongoing story in Baltimore. [The program has been credited with contributing to a 20% reduction in homicides since 2020](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/), with four neighborhoods achieving full years without homicides in 2024. That's significant. But here's the real story for early-career journalists: this progress is fragile and depends on sustained federal funding that just got cut.

**Key people to know:**
- Freedom Jones, director of violence intervention programs for Center for Hope at Lifebridge Health
- Emanuel Tarrant-Bey, Safe Streets site director in Belvedere
- Vincent Schiraldi, Department of Juvenile Services Secretary (note: [he faced calls for removal in late 2024 amid rising juvenile crime](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/11/15/local-baltimore-residents-and-politicians-call-for-change-as-juvenile-crime-remains-high/), though overall crime declined)

The public health approach to violence—treating it as an epidemic rather than solely a law enforcement problem—is relatively novel in American cities. Safe Streets operates in about 3% of the city but concentrates resources in high-impact areas. When journalists ask "why isn't this everywhere?" you're getting at real questions about resource allocation and equity.

**Undercovered angles:**
- What happens to neighborhoods that lose Safe Streets funding? This is essentially a policy experiment in reverse.
- The relationship between violence prevention workers and police—these aren't always aligned.
- How do you measure success in violence prevention when it's about things that *don't* happen?
- Which communities are excluded from the current Safe Streets zones, and why?

## Economic Recovery After Infrastructure Shock

The Key Bridge collapse should have devastated Baltimore's economy. It didn't, and that story deserves deeper exploration. [The Port of Baltimore handles roughly 12.4 million vehicles annually and generates some 15,300 direct jobs](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/26/the-history-of-baltimores-key-bridge/), making the closure a genuine crisis. But [the federal government cleared the channel in 77 days](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/), the state deployed $60 million in aid, and many small businesses survived through a combination of government support and community networks.

**Key people:**
- Dorie Murphy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers emergency management branch chief
- Jeff Peacock, debris removal chief
- Scott Cowan, president of Local 333, International Longshoremen's Association
- Various port-dependent businesses that adapted quickly

The reconstruction timeline matters: the bridge is scheduled for completion by Fall 2028, with the new design 45 feet taller to accommodate larger ships. This is a multi-year story about how a city rebuilds critical infrastructure.

**Story ideas:**
- Track the bridge reconstruction timeline and its economic ripple effects. Will businesses that rerouted to Norfolk, Philadelphia, or New Jersey return?
- Examine which small businesses *didn't* survive the closure and why. Government aid programs often have gaps.
- Explore whether the disaster prompted any meaningful infrastructure upgrades or contingency planning.
- The survey showing [73% of residents think bridge reconstruction will take longer than four years reflects broader distrust in government's ability to deliver](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/about-half-of-baltimoreans-felt-impacted-by-key-bridge-collapse-hopkins-survey-says/). That's a story about governance, not just infrastructure.

## Systemic Challenges: Vacant Properties, Child Care, and Basic Services

Beneath the headline crime numbers and bridge reconstruction lies a set of grinding structural problems that shape daily life for many Baltimoreans.

**Vacant properties:** Governor Wes Moore launched the ["Reinvest Baltimore" program in 2024 with a goal of transforming at least 5,000 vacant properties over five years](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/). The city has roughly 13,000 vacant and abandoned homes and over 20,000 vacant lots. This concentrates in lower-income neighborhoods of color. This is a story that requires patience—five-year initiatives move slowly and often face implementation problems. Watch for:
- How many properties are actually being addressed?
- Are they in the neighborhoods where they're needed, or in areas already seeing investment?
- What happens to current residents as neighborhoods change?

**Child care:** The data is alarming. [Baltimore City saw a 15.64% decrease in child care providers and 11.19% drop in child care slots between 2020 and 2024](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-city/). [Baltimore County saw similar declines, with particular shortages in infant care due to regulatory requirements](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-county/). This affects workforce participation, particularly for single mothers, many of whom form the backbone of service-sector employment. Child care providers themselves are often women of color running small family businesses with thin margins. This is an underreported economic justice story.

**Sewage backups:** This one illustrates bureaucratic dysfunction. Baltimore has a reimbursement program for sewage backup cleanup costs, but [since April 2018, only 120 people have applied and 19 were approved](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/). The city receives thousands of reports annually. Most rejections cite technical reasons—an obstruction in the line, for instance, disqualifies someone even if it rained heavily. The story here is how policies designed to protect the city from liability end up abandoning residents.

## Small Business: The Resilience Story

Baltimore's small business community offers an important counternarrative. [Research on "Smalltimore" showed how businesses with strong social connections thrive despite bureaucratic challenges](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/). These aren't scaling tech startups; they're barbershops, restaurants, bookstores, and service businesses embedded in neighborhoods. The insight is that survival often depends on social trust and community networks, not just market forces.

Key figures like Tia Hamilton (My Mamas Vegan) represent entrepreneurs who are simultaneously building business, advocating for policy change (she pushed for higher tipped wages), and supporting formerly incarcerated people. These stories matter because they show agency beyond victimhood.

**Story angles:**
- How do small businesses adapt to neighborhood change? [The Mondawmin area is experiencing revitalization with $20 million in transit improvements and new mixed-use development](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/mondawmin-small-business/), but will existing businesses benefit or get displaced?
- What role do minority-owned business associations and community development organizations play in survival?
- How do women business owners navigate different challenges than male-owned enterprises?

## Education and Youth: The Unfinished Work

The Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, signed into law in 2020, mandates trauma training for city employees. This represents a genuine policy shift toward trauma-informed practice. But implementation matters more than legislation. Are school counselors actually trained? Are rec center staff equipped to recognize and respond to trauma? [Three Frederick Douglass High School students who testified at City Hall about school violence became advocates for this measure](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/three-students-accepted-violence-in-their-lives-until-a-shooting-in-their-school/), illustrating how young people can drive policy.

Meanwhile, public education remains underfunded. A 2024 poll found [only 12% of voters rated Baltimore City schools A-B grades, with 69% unsatisfied](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/support-for-baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-is-growing-in-2024-race-for-democratic-mayoral-candidate/). This isn't new, but it's persistent. School funding and quality are perennial campaign issues with limited follow-through.

## Race, Wealth, and Geography

Baltimore's spatial inequality is partly a function of historical redlining and discrimination. [Comparing neighborhoods like Mondawmin (vacancy rate 14%, lower income) and Bolton Hill (vacancy rate 1%, nearly double the per-capita income) shows how geography traps people](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/). This isn't inevitable—it's the result of specific policies and decisions. Understanding this history matters for reporting, but don't get stuck there. The real question is: what's happening *now* to change these patterns?

Key insight: [East Baltimore communities like Midway and Belair-Edison often rely on faith-based organizations rather than city services](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/east-baltimore-communities-rely-on-faith-based-leadership-rather-than-the-city/), suggesting institutional gaps. This is a story about whether government has ceded responsibility or whether community leaders are filling genuine gaps that government couldn't.

## Practical Story Suggestions

### 1. **Violence Prevention Funding: Six Months After Cuts**
The Trump administration's $1.2 million cut to Center for Hope happened in 2025. Report back in six months. Has the organization restructured? Have crime rates ticked up in their zones? What have they cut? This is data-driven accountability journalism.

**Potential sources:** Freedom Jones (Center for Hope), other nonprofit leaders, police statistics, residents in Safe Streets zones

### 2. **Where Are the Bridge Workers Now?**
Six construction workers died in the Key Bridge collapse. The city established a permanent scholarship fund in their honor. Report on: Are families receiving support? Has the scholarship been funded? How many students have benefited? This keeps focus on human cost, not just infrastructure.

### 3. **Child Care Desert: The Economic Spillover**
Interview working mothers who can't find affordable child care. What did they have to give up? How many left the workforce? This connects child care shortage to employment and wage data. You're telling an economic story.

### 4. **Reinvest Baltimore: Keeping Score**
Six months or a year into the program, request data: How many properties converted? In which neighborhoods? Who owns/operates them? Are residents being displaced or supported? This is accountability reporting on a major state initiative.

### 5. **The Mondawmin Question: Revitalization for Whom?**
The area is getting investment. Follow specific streets or blocks. Are existing businesses thriving, struggling, or leaving? Are new residents replacing longtime residents? Who profits from revitalization? This is gentrification reporting, which requires nuance—investment can coexist with displacement.

### 6. **Small Businesses Two Years After the Bridge Collapse**
Those trucking companies, restaurants, and service businesses adapted. How sustainable were their adaptations? Did they fully recover? Did they close? Are they still vulnerable to disruption?

### 7. **Faith Communities as Infrastructure**
Many East Baltimore residents rely on churches for food, mental health support, and social services. Why? Is this a gap in government services or an expression of community preference? What's sustainable about relying on volunteer-led organizations?

### 8. **Mayor Brandon Scott at Midterm**
Scott took office in 2020 and [led crime reduction efforts, improving his approval ratings from 37% to 46% by 2024](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/support-for-baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-is-growing-in-2024-race-for-democratic-mayoral-candidate/). But how much of the crime reduction is attributable to his policies versus national trends? What's left unaddressed? This is the accountability story about a mayor's actual impact.

## A Final Note on Approach

Baltimore's real challenges are grinding, not dramatic. They involve budgets, implementation, policy details, and long-term trends more than sudden crises. The bridge collapse was dramatic; violence prevention is not. Your job as an early-career journalist is to make the grinding stories matter to readers—to show why a child care shortage or vacant property program or faith-based safety net deserves attention. Connect the systemic to the personal. Show the city not as a failure or a success story, but as a place where specific people are trying specific solutions to real problems, with uncertain outcomes.

The best Baltimore journalism doesn't sentimentalize struggle or assume failure. It asks: What's actually happening? Who benefits? What's left unaddressed? Why?
