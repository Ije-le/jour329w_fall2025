# Baltimore Beat Guide for Journalists

Welcome to Baltimore. If you're new to covering this city, you're stepping into a community facing profound challenges—but also one working hard to address them. This guide draws on recent coverage to help you understand what's happening now and where story opportunities remain.

## Understanding Baltimore's Current Moment

Baltimore is dealing with the aftermath of multiple crises while simultaneously working toward recovery. The city saw historic violence reduction in 2024, with crime falling significantly after years of elevated rates. Yet many neighborhoods still struggle with poverty, vacant housing, and limited economic opportunity—legacies of decades of disinvestment and segregation.

The [Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/26/the-history-of-baltimores-key-bridge/) in March 2024 created immediate disruption but demonstrated the city's resilience. The disaster closed the Port of Baltimore temporarily, disrupting supply chains and threatening jobs. However, quick federal response and state assistance programs helped most workers and businesses [weather the crisis](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/). The port reopened within months, and by fall 2024, business had largely recovered. Still, the bridge won't be rebuilt until 2028, and commute patterns remain disrupted.

## Key Players and Institutions

**Mayor Brandon Scott** won reelection in 2024 and has emphasized crime reduction as his signature achievement. His administration points to programs like Safe Streets as effective interventions. Scott's opponent in that race was former Mayor **Sheila Dixon**, who served from 2007-2010 before resigning amid ethics violations.

The **Safe Streets program**, administered by LifeBridge Health's Center for Hope, uses a public health approach to violence prevention rather than relying solely on policing. Director **Freedom Jones** and site director **Emanuel Tarrant-Bey** (in Belvedere) are knowledgeable sources. In 2024, four Safe Streets zones went an entire year without homicides—a remarkable achievement. However, the program faced [$1.2 million in federal funding cuts](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/) from the Trump administration in early 2025, threatening its future despite demonstrable success.

**Governor Wes Moore** has made Baltimore investment a priority, including the "Reinvest Baltimore" program targeting 5,000 vacant properties over five years. **Jake Day**, secretary of Maryland Housing & Community Development, chairs the coordinating council.

The **Port of Baltimore** is an economic engine for the region, handling 52.3 million tons of cargo in 2023 and supporting about 51,000 jobs directly or indirectly. Understanding how maritime commerce affects neighborhoods, jobs, and the broader economy is essential for covering Baltimore.

## Baltimore City vs. Baltimore County: Critical Distinction

**Do not confuse Baltimore City with Baltimore County.** They are separate jurisdictions with different governments, leadership, budgets, and problems.

- **Baltimore City** is an independent city with about 575,000 residents. It has its own mayor, city council, police department, and school system. The city faces concentrated poverty, high crime rates, and significant vacant housing.

- **Baltimore County** surrounds the city on three sides and has about 850,000 residents. It's governed by a county executive and county council. It's generally more suburban, wealthier, and has different school and police systems.

Many state institutions and regional facilities are located in the city but serve the broader metropolitan area. When writing about crime statistics, schools, housing, or local government actions, be absolutely clear which jurisdiction you're discussing. A story about Baltimore County schools has nothing to do with Baltimore City Schools.

For example, Rep. Elijah Cummings represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which includes parts of both the city and county—but when covering his work, be specific about which communities you're discussing.

## Violence and Crime: The Most Important Story

Crime has been Baltimore's defining challenge for years, though recent trends show improvement. The city recorded its lowest monthly homicide total in recorded history in April 2025 (just five homicides). Overall, violent crime [decreased about 20%](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/support-for-baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-is-growing-in-2024-race-for-democratic-mayoral-candidate/) since Mayor Scott took office in 2020.

However, some neighborhoods remain deeply affected. Squeegee workers—mostly young people who wash car windows at intersections for tips—became controversial after a [2022 shooting death](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/10/baltimore-city-reveals-plan-for-controversial-squeegee-workers/). The city created a plan balancing enforcement in high-traffic zones with workforce training opportunities, though implementation has been uneven.

**Story angles:**
- How are Safe Streets and similar community programs actually preventing violence? What happens if federal funding disappears?
- The city's juvenile justice system faces [ongoing criticism](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/11/15/local-baltimore-residents-and-politicians-call-for-change-as-juvenile-crime-remains-high/). Follow what happens with Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who faced calls for removal.
- What explains the dramatic crime reduction in 2024-2025? Is it sustainable? Interview people in neighborhoods like Park Heights, Woodburne-McCabe, and Franklin Square that went a full year without homicides.
- Explore where violence *isn't* happening and why. The drop in street crime outpaced residential crime—what changed?

**Promising locations:** Safe Streets sites in Belvedere, McElderry Park; community meetings in Park Heights; police district stations; hospital emergency rooms that see gunshot victims.

## Economic Development and Inequality

Baltimore's wealth inequality is stark and reflects historical redlining and segregation. Adjacent neighborhoods can have dramatically different income levels, vacancy rates, and opportunities.

The **Mondawmin area** in West Baltimore illustrates both the challenges and potential. The neighborhood has struggled since the 2015 unrest following Freddie Gray's death. But recent years have brought new investment: The Village at Mondawmin (a [$1.2 billion development](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/mondawmin-small-business/) in the old Target space), transit improvements ($20 million federal grant for Mondawmin Station), and small business growth. Still, the area deals with violence, limited retail, and a 13.93% housing vacancy rate.

**Mario Chang**, who owns Gera Variety Discount Liquors near Mondawmin Mall and leads the Korean Business Association, has been in the area for decades and understands both the challenges and the unrealized potential.

Small businesses operate throughout Baltimore despite structural obstacles. The ["Smalltimore" project](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/) examined how small business owners create tight-knit networks even as they navigate bureaucracy and economic headwinds. **Bobby LaPin** (Boat Baltimore) noted that "small businesses in Baltimore exist, despite the bureaucracy and all the red tape, and they exist because people in Baltimore love Baltimore."

**Story angles:**
- Follow the Reinvest Baltimore program's progress. Which neighborhoods are getting investment? Which aren't? Why?
- The city has 13,000 vacant homes and 20,000+ vacant lots. What happens to neighborhoods with high concentrations of vacant properties? How do residents organize to address this?
- Small business owners face unique challenges around financing, regulations, and safety. Who's succeeding despite obstacles? Organizations like the Greater Baltimore Black Chamber of Commerce and Innovation Works Baltimore support entrepreneurs—what's working?
- Old Town and Carrollton Ridge represent struggling neighborhoods. What keeps them down? What initiatives might help?

**Promising locations:** Mondawmin Mall area; West North Avenue Development Authority; Old Town; E.M.A.G.E. Center (Rasheed Aziz's entrepreneurial training program for youth); small business corridors.

## Housing and Neighborhoods

About 28% of properties in some Southwest Baltimore neighborhoods are vacant and abandoned. The city's tax sale system can trap low-income homeowners who fall behind on property taxes, with investors buying liens and potentially foreclosing. The [reimbursement program for sewage backups](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/) in homes illustrates how city systems often fail residents—the program has strict eligibility requirements, and fewer than 120 people received reimbursement between 2018-2021 despite thousands of reported backups.

**Dawn Ford**, a 62-year-old homeowner in Carrollton Ridge, exemplifies how homeowners become trapped. She lives on $488.67 monthly Social Security, can't afford repairs to her deteriorating rowhouse, but can't afford to move either. Her house is assessed at just $15,000. She uses Sevin dust (an outdoor pesticide) inside to combat roaches because she can't afford professional extermination.

**Story angles:**
- How does Baltimore's tax sale system actually work? Who profits? Who loses homes? Organizations like Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service (contact **Amy Hennen**, managing attorney) connect low-income residents with legal help.
- Infrastructure failures affect vulnerable residents disproportionately. The sewage backup story remains relevant—has the city improved its response?
- Gentrification vs. investment: How do neighborhoods balance welcoming development while protecting existing residents? Bolton Hill and Mondawmin sit just two miles apart but have vastly different vacancy rates (1% vs. 14%) and incomes.

**Promising locations:** Neighborhoods with high vacancy rates; tax sale auctions; housing court; community development corporations in specific neighborhoods.

## Education and Youth

Baltimore City Schools face persistent challenges, though specific current data wasn't emphasized in recent coverage. However, youth programs show promise. **Wesley Hawkins** runs The Nolita Project, mentoring Baltimore teenagers who face trauma. His approach: go where kids are—schools, homes, bus stops—rather than waiting for them to seek help. **Damion Cooper** teaches yoga and martial arts to middle school boys to help them manage stress and anger.

The death of Rep. **Elijah Cummings** in 2019 remains significant. Students from Frederick Douglass High School—**Jaionna Santos**, **Bryonna Harris**, and **Damani Thomas**—testified at City Council about violence in their lives, helping catalyze the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, which requires city workers to receive trauma training.

**Story angles:**
- What's the current state of trauma-informed programs in schools? The Healing City Act mandated training—how's implementation going?
- Youth violence prevention: What programs actually work? The Nolita Project and similar community-based efforts operate outside traditional institutions.
- How are schools addressing chronic absenteeism? What happens to teens who disconnect from school entirely?

**Promising locations:** Frederick Douglass High School; The Reach! Partnership School; community centers; rec centers; programs like The Nolita Project.

## Community Organizing and Activism

Baltimore has strong traditions of community organizing, often centered on churches and grassroots groups. **Rev. Derrick DeWitt** of First Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Sandtown-Winchester runs extensive food distribution and community support programs, particularly important during COVID-19. His church went from serving weekly meals to distributing food six days a week during the pandemic.

**Troy Staton** operates New Beginnings barbershop in the Hollins Market neighborhood, which partners with Kaiser Permanente to provide health screenings, mental health support, and other services. The barbershop model leverages the trust barbers have with clients to reach people who might not otherwise access healthcare.

**Nneka N'namdi** founded Fight Blight Bmore to address vacancy and help residents identify, report, and track blighted properties. **Lamontre Randall** at Innovation Works Baltimore focuses on supporting social entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.

**Story angles:**
- How do faith communities provide social services that government can't or won't? What happens if funding dries up?
- Barbershops and salons as community health hubs—is this model expanding? What health outcomes improve?
- Community organizing around specific issues (blight, crime, education)—what strategies work?

**Promising locations:** Churches that run food programs; barbershops partnering with health providers; community development organizations; neighborhood association meetings.

## Ongoing and Unresolved Stories

Several major stories remain in flux:

**Safe Streets funding crisis:** The Trump administration cut $1.2 million from Safe Streets in early 2025, threatening a program credited with historic crime reductions. At least $8 million in federal grants were cut citywide. This story is very much unresolved—check on the program's status.

**Key Bridge reconstruction:** The bridge won't reopen until 2028. How are communities adapting to changed commute patterns? Are infrastructure investments reaching affected neighborhoods? The federal government committed $2 billion—track how that money flows.

**Juvenile justice reform:** Calls to remove DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi haven't been resolved. What's happening with juvenile crime rates and system responses?

**Squeegee workers:** The city announced enforcement zones and workforce training in 2022, but implementation has been spotty. Are programs reaching young people? What's enforcement actually look like?

**Housing programs:** Reinvest Baltimore aims to address 5,000 vacant properties by 2028. Track progress neighborhood by neighborhood.

**Port recovery:** Business recovered quickly after the bridge collapse, but are there lasting impacts? Are workers who lost jobs back to work?

## Underexplored Angles

Based on the coverage patterns, here are potentially underexplored stories:

1. **Environmental justice:** Sewage backups, trash dumping in vacant lots, industrial pollution—how do these affect health in specific neighborhoods? The sewage backup story touched on this but more remains.

2. **Immigrant communities:** Puerto Rican families resettled after Hurricane Maria with help from Fundación Janet Arce. What happened to them? Are there other recent immigrant populations changing neighborhoods?

3. **Child care deserts:** Baltimore City lost 15.6% of child care providers between 2020-2024. How does this affect working parents, particularly single mothers? Providers like **Yvonne Turner** (Old Mother Hubbard's Child Care Center) and **LaKesha Solomon** (Solomon's Family Daycare) serve vulnerable populations.

4. **Food access:** During COVID-19, Henderson-Hopkins School distributed 319,000+ pounds of food. What's the current state of food insecurity? Where are food deserts? Soul Kitchen (run by **Carolyn Anewich** at Govans Presbyterian Church) continues serving meals—are similar programs sustaining?

5. **Digital divide:** About 20% of Baltimore households lack computers. How does this affect job access, education, telemedicine?

6. **Health disparities:** Barbershops provide health screenings, but what about broader healthcare access? What happens to people who can't afford care?

7. **Arts and culture:** The Maryland Theatre expansion, museum growth—how does cultural investment affect communities? Who benefits?

8. **Youth entrepreneurship:** Programs like E.M.A.G.E. Center teach business skills to high schoolers. Are participants actually starting businesses? What barriers remain?

9. **Transit equity:** Mondawmin Station got $20 million for improvements, but broader transit access remains limited. How does lack of reliable transportation trap people in poverty?

10. **Small business survival:** The "Smalltimore" project showed tight-knit networks, but what specific policy changes would help small businesses? What bureaucratic barriers could be reduced?

## Practical Reporting Tips

**Start with community leaders, not officials.** In many Baltimore neighborhoods, pastors, small business owners, and longtime residents understand problems better than government officials. They're also often more accessible.

**Visit neighborhoods at different times.** Morning, afternoon, evening—you'll see different aspects of community life. Talk to people on porches, in corner stores, waiting for buses.

**Follow the money.** Whether it's Safe Streets funding, housing programs, or port recovery assistance, track where money goes and who benefits. Program promises don't always match reality.

**Be specific about geography.** Don't write "Baltimore" when you mean a specific neighborhood. West Baltimore isn't one thing—it includes Mondawmin, Sandtown-Winchester, Carrollton Ridge, and other distinct communities.

**Mind the City/County distinction.** Always. Check twice. Readers notice when you conflate them.

**Look for solutions, not just problems.** Baltimore has plenty of dysfunction, but also people doing remarkable work with limited resources. Both deserve coverage.

**Build source relationships over time.** This isn't a city where you parachute in for quick hits. Trust matters. Return calls. Follow up on stories.

**Consider trauma.** Many sources have experienced violence, loss, and hardship. Be respectful. Don't extract stories without building relationships. Understand that some sources (like the Frederick Douglass High School students who testified after a school shooting) are still processing trauma.

## Essential Context

Baltimore's challenges didn't emerge overnight. The city's [history of redlining and segregation](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/) shaped current inequality. Understanding this history helps explain why adjacent neighborhoods have such different outcomes.

The 2015 unrest after Freddie Gray's death remains relevant context. It catalyzed some reforms but also deepened some problems. Three years later, businesses were [still recovering](https://cnsmaryland.org/2018/04/17/baltimore-neighborhood-recovery-continues-three-years-after-the-death-of-freddie-gray/).

The city's population has been declining for decades, creating fiscal challenges. Vacant housing is both cause and effect of this decline.

## A Final Word

Baltimore stories often fall into crisis narratives that strip residents of dignity and agency. The city has real problems—don't minimize them. But also recognize resilience, creativity, and determination. 

The best Baltimore journalism shows how structural failures affect real people while highlighting those working for change. It holds powerful institutions accountable while amplifying community voices. It's specific about neighborhoods, problems, and solutions rather than painting the whole city with one brush.

Your sources include a mayor fighting for a second term, small business owners navigating bureaucracy, pastors running food programs, violence interrupters preventing shootings, homeowners trapped by poverty, youth mentors, barbershop owners providing health screenings, and countless others working to improve their corner of the city.

Start there. Listen. Be accurate. Be fair. Return their calls. Tell stories that matter.
