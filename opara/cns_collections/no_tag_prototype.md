# Baltimore Beat Coverage Guide for Early-Career Journalists

## Welcome to Baltimore

You're about to cover one of America's most complex and resilient cities. Baltimore isn't just the backdrop for *The Wire*—it's a living, breathing community where dedicated leaders, struggling families, and innovative problem-solvers are working every day to address challenges that have been decades in the making. This guide will help you understand the landscape, identify story opportunities, and avoid common pitfalls.

## Understanding the Geographic Distinction: City vs. County

**This is crucial**: Baltimore City and Baltimore County are completely separate jurisdictions. Mix them up and you'll lose credibility fast.

- **Baltimore City** is an independent city with its own government, police force, school system, and tax structure. Population: approximately 585,000. It's one of only a few independent cities in the U.S. that isn't part of any county.
- **Baltimore County** surrounds the city on three sides (water on the fourth) but is a separate entity with different leadership, services, and demographics.

**How to avoid mixing them up:**
- Always specify "Baltimore City" or "Baltimore County" in your stories
- Know that child care providers, schools, tax policies, and many social services operate under entirely different systems
- When interviewing sources, confirm which jurisdiction they're discussing
- Crime statistics, economic data, and demographic information are tracked separately

**Key difference example**: The [child care analysis from 2024](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-county/) shows Baltimore County lost 18.16% of child care providers between 2020-2024, while [Baltimore City](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-city/) lost 15.64%—similar trajectories but distinct problems requiring different solutions.

## Key People and Institutions You Should Know

### City Leadership

**Mayor Brandon Scott** is Baltimore's 52nd mayor (elected 2020, winning his 2024 reelection campaign convincingly). A native Baltimorean who previously served as City Council president, Scott has emphasized crime reduction and violence prevention. Under his administration, [homicides have dropped 20%](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/support-for-baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-is-growing-in-2024-race-for-democratic-mayoral-candidate/) from 2020 levels, though the city still sees over 300 homicides annually.

**Jake Day**, secretary of Maryland Housing & Community Development, is leading the ["Reinvest Baltimore" initiative](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/) targeting 5,000 vacant properties over five years—a massive undertaking in a city with roughly 13,000 vacant structures.

**Gov. Wes Moore** (elected 2022) is Maryland's first Black governor and has made Baltimore revitalization a priority, though his administration recently cut federal funding to violence prevention programs including Safe Streets.

### Community Leaders and Organizations

**Safe Streets/Center for Hope**: The city's primary violence intervention program, operated by Lifebridge Health. [Despite success in reducing violence](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/), it faces $1.2 million in Trump administration budget cuts. Four Safe Streets zones achieved zero homicides in 2024—Belvedere, Park Heights, Woodburne-McCabe, and Franklin Square. This is your go-to source for understanding grassroots violence prevention.

**Emanuel Tarrant-Bey** (Safe Streets site director in Belvedere) and **Freedom Jones** (director of violence intervention programs for Center for Hope) are articulate spokespeople who can explain the public health approach to violence.

**Wesley Hawkins** runs The Nolita Project, mentoring Baltimore teenagers dealing with trauma. He embodies the gig-economy hustle many community leaders must maintain—running multiple programs, taking graduate courses, and even running for office (he lost a 2020 City Council primary).

**Nneka N'namdi** founded Fight Blight Bmore in 2016 after seeing children playing near a dangerous demolition site. She's data-driven and can explain vacancy and blight issues with both passion and statistics.

### The Legacy of Elijah Cummings

The late Rep. Elijah Cummings (died October 2019 at age 68) remains a touchstone for Baltimore. The [Elijah Cummings Healing City Act](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/), passed in February 2020, requires all city employees to receive trauma-informed care training. When President Trump called Baltimore "a disgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess" in July 2019, it galvanized the city. Cummings' name still opens doors and commands respect.

## Critical Issues and Story Angles

### Violence and Public Safety

Baltimore continues to see over 300 homicides annually, though April 2025 marked [the lowest monthly total in recorded history with just five homicides](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/). This presents a paradox worth exploring: violence is declining but remains stubbornly high.

**Ongoing story**: The future of Safe Streets funding. With federal cuts threatening the program just as it's showing results, this is a developing story with real stakes. Check in with Center for Hope quarterly.

**Undercovered angles**:
- What happens to the community organizations that lose federal funding? Where do their clients go?
- The impact of convenience store crime—violent and non-violent crime spiked at convenience stores in 2024, according to BPD data
- How do rec center workers, teachers, and sanitation workers implement trauma-informed care under the Healing City Act? Get specific examples.
- The squeegee worker debate continues to simmer. The city's 2022 multi-tiered approach included enforcement zones and workforce programs, but implementation and effectiveness remain unclear.

**Interview locations**: Safe Streets sites in Belvedere, Park Heights; Mother's Grille in Federal Hill (for Preakness/community events); New Beginnings barbershop (for health and community perspectives).

### Infrastructure and Quality of Life

**The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse** (March 26, 2024) transformed Baltimore overnight. [About half of residents reported daily disruption](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/about-half-of-baltimoreans-felt-impacted-by-key-bridge-collapse-hopkins-survey-says/), with significant impacts on commuting and family access. The Port of Baltimore, which handles 847,000 cars and light trucks annually, was temporarily shut.

**Caveat**: As of this writing, the new bridge design has been unveiled with a 45-foot taller deck, funded by federal dollars, and scheduled for Fall 2028 completion. However, [reconstruction progress](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/) and port recovery remain ongoing stories.

**Story opportunities**:
- How have commute patterns permanently changed? Are workers who rerouted through I-95/I-895 tunnels ever coming back?
- Small business impact beyond the immediate aftermath—which businesses are still struggling?
- What happened to the trucking companies that had to register in Norfolk? Did they return?

**Sewage and water infrastructure** is an evergreen story. Baltimore's [century-old sewer system](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/) continues to fail residents. The city's reimbursement program for sewage backups has approved only 19 of 120 applications since 2018—an 84% rejection rate. The program now offers direct cleanup through the S.O.S. pilot program (launched March 2023), but eligibility remains restrictive.

**Undercovered**: Follow up on residents who were denied reimbursement. What's their status now? Has the S.O.S. program actually helped people, or does it have the same eligibility problems?

### Economic Development and Housing

**Vacancy crisis**: With 13,000 vacant structures and 20,000+ vacant lots, Baltimore's blight shapes daily life. The ["Reinvest Baltimore" initiative](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/) aims to transform 5,000 properties in five years, but progress tracking will be essential.

**Neighborhood disparities**: The wealth gap between neighborhoods like [Mondawmin and Bolton Hill](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/) illustrates Baltimore's deep structural inequalities. Mondawmin: 14% vacancy, $24,625 per capita income. Bolton Hill: 1% vacancy, $45,263 per capita income. They're two miles apart.

**Small business ecosystem**: The ["Smalltimore" project](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/) revealed how small businesses create tight-knit community networks despite bureaucratic challenges. Bobby LaPin (Boat Baltimore) put it well: small businesses exist "despite the bureaucracy...because people in Baltimore love Baltimore."

**Undercovered angles**:
- Track the Mondawmin area development: The Village at Mondawmin (former Target site) opened in 2022-23 with CareFirst, Edenbridge Pace, TouchPoint Baltimore, and Whiting-Turner as tenants. Is it succeeding as a catalyst? Has foot traffic increased?
- Frederick Douglass High School's $118 million renovation (part of the 21st Century School Building Program)—when complete, what's the community impact?
- Food access in "food deserts"—Sandtown-Winchester has 109 places to buy liquor and no grocery stores. How are residents coping in 2025?

### Child Care and Education

Baltimore City lost 15.64% of child care providers between 2020-2024 (from 793 to 669), [creating acute access problems](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-city/). Infant care is particularly difficult due to regulations.

**Quote to remember**: "Because of the regulations and because of the guidelines that surround children under the age of 2, many of the providers and centers are no longer taking infants," said Brenda Velez-Jimenez, a licensed family child care provider.

**Story ideas**:
- What happened to the families who lost access? Are parents dropping out of the workforce?
- Interview the 25 remaining top-rated (5-star EXCELS) facilities in Baltimore City—down from 29 in 2020
- The neighborhood-based model described in ["Mothers of Baltimore"](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/mothers-of-baltimore/)—Yvonne Turner (Old Mother Hubbard's), LaKesha Solomon (Solomon's Family Daycare), Latoya Turpin (Little Steps Childcare)—represents a critical support system. How are they faring financially?

### Public Health and Social Services

**Food insecurity** intensified during COVID and remains elevated. [Multiple feeding programs](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/12/17/volunteers-are-working-harder-as-covid-heightens-the-need-for-food/) operate across the city, from Henderson-Hopkins School (distributing 10,000 pounds weekly) to First Mount Calvary Baptist Church (feeding 18,000+ between May-October 2020).

**Barbershops as health centers**: [New Beginnings barbershop](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-barbershops-help-clients-cope-with-citys-senseless-violence/) offers blood pressure checks, HIV testing, and flu shots through a Kaiser Permanente partnership. This model—leveraging trusted community spaces—works because "by the virtue of what [barbers] do, you have to let down your shields," as UMD professor Stephen B. Thomas explained.

**Undercovered**:
- Where are the food distribution sites in 2025? Has federal funding changed?
- Mental health services remain stigmatized in Black communities. Who's doing innovative outreach?
- The trauma-informed care mandate from the Healing City Act—get specific implementation examples

## Story Ideas and Undercovered Angles

### Immediate Follow-ups

1. **Safe Streets funding crisis**: Contact Freedom Jones and Emanuel Tarrant-Bey monthly to track what's happening as federal funding disappears. Which zones are most affected? What stops working first?

2. **Squeegee worker policy**: The 2022 framework included six enforcement zones and workforce programs. Who's enrolled? What's the retention rate? Visit the intersection of President Street and I-83 (one of the designated zones) to observe current enforcement.

3. **Key Bridge reconstruction**: Interview truckers, stevedores, and Port of Baltimore workers about whether business has returned to pre-collapse levels. Visit neighborhoods in Dundalk and Sparrows Point to gauge economic recovery.

4. **Vacant property transformation**: The "Reinvest Baltimore" goal is 5,000 properties in five years—that's 1,000 annually. Get quarterly numbers from Jake Day's office. Which neighborhoods are seeing action? Which aren't?

5. **S.O.S. sewage cleanup program**: Launched March 2023, it had helped only five people by May 2023. Call Yosef Kebede (DPW) for updated numbers. Interview residents like Leah Brown who were denied help despite qualifying circumstances.

### Longer-term Enterprise

1. **The real cost of trauma**: Profile a teacher, police officer, and rec center worker who've gone through Healing City Act training. What changed in how they do their jobs? Get concrete examples, not abstractions.

2. **Neighborhood divergence**: Pick two adjacent neighborhoods with wildly different outcomes (like Mondawmin/Bolton Hill or Old Town/Little Italy). What specific policies or investments created the gap? Can interventions close it?

3. **The gig economy hustle**: Profile multiple community leaders like Wesley Hawkins who cobble together various income streams to do social good. What would it take for them to focus on one mission? Calculate the actual economics.

4. **Small business survival**: Return to businesses profiled in the "Smalltimore" project. Which survived? What was the determining factor—social connections, location, financial reserves?

5. **Child care deserts mapped**: Create an interactive map showing where child care providers closed between 2020-2024. Overlay with employment data and poverty rates. Where's the crisis most acute?

6. **Food insecurity post-pandemic**: The Maryland Food Bank saw 96% increase in distribution during COVID. Where are levels now? Profile families who've been using emergency food consistently for 3+ years.

7. **Youth trauma intervention**: The Frederick Douglass High School shooting (Feb. 8, 2019) led three students to testify at City Council, helping pass the Healing City Act. Where are those students now? What happened at the school? Has trauma-informed care made a difference?

8. **Redlining's long shadow**: Use BNIA data showing how redlined neighborhoods still have lower incomes, higher vacancy, worse health outcomes. Make it concrete with three families from three redlined neighborhoods.

9. **The Puerto Rican resettlement**: Fundación Janet Arce helped multiple families relocate to Baltimore after Hurricane Maria. Where are they now? Did Baltimore work out?

10. **Death of institutions**: Trace what happened to Old Town Mall, once a thriving commercial center with 64 stores, now largely vacant. What would genuine revitalization look like?

### Investigative Threads

**Caveat**: These are unresolved issues where the outcomes aren't yet clear:

- **Public corruption**: The Catherine Pugh "Healthy Holly" scandal (she received three years in federal prison in 2020) raised questions about UMMS board oversight. Has anything actually changed in how the system handles board member conflicts of interest?

- **Tax sale system**: The reimbursement program meant to help low-income homeowners facing tax sales has serious problems. Raymond Thompson nearly lost his house despite doing everything right (his paperwork was lost). Profile others in this situation.

- **Water contamination**: The August 2022 E. coli outbreak affected West Baltimore. What systemic issues remain? The city has billions in federal infrastructure money—where's it going?

- **Preakness Stakes location**: The threatened move to Laurel Park seems to have stalled, but tensions between Stronach Group and the city remain. What's the real status as of 2025?

- **Juvenile crime**: The Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi faced calls for removal in 2024 over rising juvenile crime. What happened? What are current juvenile crime trends?

### Source Diversity Checklist

Baltimore is 62% Black, 28% white, 5% Hispanic. Your source list should reflect that. When covering predominantly Black neighborhoods like Sandtown-Winchester or Mondawmin, center Black voices—not just as subjects but as experts and analysts.

- [ ] Have I talked to residents, not just officials?
- [ ] Have I included voices from both City and County (if relevant)?
- [ ] Am I centering the people most affected by the issue?
- [ ] Have I sought out community leaders, not just institutional spokespeople?
- [ ] Do my sources reflect the racial/ethnic makeup of the area?
- [ ] Have I talked to young people if the story affects them?

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't lead with "The Wire"**: Yes, everyone's seen it. Baltimore residents are tired of it. Lead with current reality.

2. **Don't conflate City and County**: I can't stress this enough. They're different governments, different tax bases, different school systems.

3. **Don't write off struggling neighborhoods**: Places like Mondawmin and Sandtown-Winchester have deep community ties and resident-led improvement efforts. Those stories exist alongside the challenges.

4. **Don't ignore historic context**: Redlining, white flight, deindustrialization—these aren't ancient history. They explain present conditions.

5. **Don't forget the Port**: It's easy to overlook, but the Port of Baltimore generated 15,300 direct jobs and 140,000 total jobs pre-collapse. It matters economically.

6. **Don't assume programs failed**: Just because something doesn't get renewed doesn't mean it didn't work. Safe Streets succeeded, then lost federal funding. That's a political story, not a program failure.

7. **Don't parachute in**: Spend time in neighborhoods before writing about them. Eat at local restaurants. Ride the buses. Sit in parks.

## Data Resources

- **Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA)**: [https://bniajfi.org](https://bniajfi.org) — Comprehensive neighborhood-level data
- **Baltimore Police Department Crime Statistics**: Track monthly crime data by location type
- **Open Baltimore Data Portal**: City government datasets on everything from 311 calls to property records
- **Maryland State Department of Education**: Child care provider data
- **U.S. Census Bureau**: Demographic and economic data, but check BNIA first for local granularity

## A Final Word

Baltimore is exhausting and exhilarating to cover. It will break your heart and restore your faith, sometimes in the same day. The people doing the work—community leaders hustling in the gig economy, teachers dealing with trauma, barbershops offering health screenings, volunteers distributing food—they're not naive about the challenges. They're clear-eyed and determined.

Your job is to document both what's broken and what's being built. Tell the stories of people like Bryonna Harris, who lost her brother and father but testified at City Council to help pass the Healing City Act. Or Mario Chang, who's operated a liquor store in Mondawmin for 32 years and believes in the neighborhood's potential despite everything. Or Latoya Turpin, who started a home day care because other centers "cared more about the money than the quality of child care."

These are the people making Baltimore work, against long odds and with insufficient resources. They deserve coverage that's as serious and sustained as their efforts.

Welcome to the beat.
