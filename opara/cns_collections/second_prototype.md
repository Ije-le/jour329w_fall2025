# Covering Baltimore: A Guide for Early-Career Journalists

Welcome to Baltimore. This city isn't just your assignment—it's a complex, resilient community that demands nuanced understanding and careful reporting. Based on the coverage patterns in your clips, here's what you need to know.

## Understanding the Fundamental Tensions

Baltimore operates under persistent structural challenges that shape nearly every story you'll cover. The city wrestles with violence, economic inequality, aging infrastructure, and political turbulence. But here's what matters: these aren't abstract problems. They're lived experiences affecting real people who've developed remarkable resilience and community-focused solutions.

When covering crime and violence, understand that Baltimore has seen some progress. [The city experienced a 20% reduction in homicides under Mayor Brandon Scott's administration](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/25/support-for-baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-is-growing-in-2024-race-for-democratic-mayoral-candidate/), marking the lowest homicide rate in nine years. However, [the Safe Streets program, credited with contributing to these improvements, faces budget cuts from the Trump administration](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/). This represents an important ongoing story: violence prevention programs work, but funding remains precarious.

## Key People and Institutions

**Mayor Brandon Scott** has emerged as a significant figure, winning reelection with emphasis on crime reduction through non-policing methods like the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE). His approach contrasts with more enforcement-focused strategies.

**The late Rep. Elijah Cummings** remains an important reference point for understanding Baltimore's political culture and community values. His legacy influences how residents think about representation and advocacy.

**Gov. Wes Moore** plays an important state-level role affecting Baltimore, including [executive action on vacant properties](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/) and infrastructure funding decisions.

Key institutions include:
- **Lifebridge Health Center for Hope** (administers Safe Streets program)
- **Maryland Food Bank** (critical safety net organization)
- **Johns Hopkins University and Hospital** (major employer and research institution)
- **Port of Baltimore** (economic engine for the region)

## The Infrastructure Crisis: Not Just Politics

The [Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/26/distress-call-precedes-disaster-at-baltimore-bridge/) in March 2024 wasn't just a transportation story—it was a lens into Baltimore's economic vulnerabilities and resilience. The swift federal response (clearing the channel in 77 days) and state assistance helped [Baltimore avert economic catastrophe](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/), but smaller businesses still struggled.

Here's an undercovered angle: How did the rerouting of traffic and shipping affect different neighborhoods inequitably? [Survey data showed about half of residents felt impacted](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/about-half-of-baltimoreans-felt-impacted-by-key-bridge-collapse-hopkins-survey-says/), but deeper reporting could examine how low-income communities without cars experienced different disruptions than suburban commuters.

**Story idea**: As the new bridge opens (scheduled for Fall 2028), examine which businesses and communities actually benefited from reconstruction spending versus those that simply absorbed losses.

## Baltimore City vs. Baltimore County: Critical Distinction

**Never confuse these two jurisdictions.** They are separate governments with different leadership, budgets, and challenges.

**Baltimore City** is an independent city, not part of any county. It has:
- Mayor Brandon Scott (executive)
- City Council (legislative)
- Its own police department, school system, and services
- About 576,000 residents
- Significantly higher poverty and crime rates

**Baltimore County** surrounds the city but is separate, with:
- County Executive (currently this varies by election cycle—verify current leadership)
- County Council
- Separate police, schools, services
- About 854,000 residents
- Generally more suburban character

The coverage shows [childcare provider numbers fell in both jurisdictions](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-county/) but for different reasons. City providers face demand from low-income families; county providers face different economic pressures. Always specify which jurisdiction you're covering.

## The Trauma and Resilience Beat

Several stories demonstrate an important thread: Baltimore has developed community-based approaches to addressing trauma, from [barbershops offering health services](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-barbershops-help-clients-cope-with-citys-senseless-violence/) to the [Elijah Cummings Healing City Act requiring trauma training for city workers](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/three-students-accepted-violence-in-their-lives-until-a-shooting-in-their-school/).

**Undercovered angles**:
- How are trauma-informed approaches being implemented (or not) in city agencies three years after the Healing City Act passed?
- What happened to the young people featured in trauma coverage—the students from Frederick Douglass High School or participants in programs like The Nolita Project?
- How do neighborhoods with high ACE scores compare in accessing mental health services?

## Housing and Neighborhood Inequality

The coverage reveals stark disparities between neighborhoods. [Mondawmin and Bolton Hill sit close together but have vastly different vacancy rates and incomes](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/). Understanding historical redlining remains essential to covering present-day Baltimore.

Gov. Moore's ["Reinvest Baltimore" program aims to transform 5,000 vacant properties](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/) over five years. This is an ongoing story to track.

**Story ideas**:
- Create a tracker of vacant property transformation: Where are the 5,000 properties? Who's getting them? What's actually being built?
- The [sewage backup reimbursement program](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/) approved only 19 of 120 applications. Has this improved? Are new programs working better?
- Examine property tax sale system impacts (ongoing concern in coverage) and recent reforms

## Food Security and Mutual Aid

Baltimore has robust [community-based food distribution networks](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/12/17/volunteers-are-working-harder-as-covid-heightens-the-need-for-food/) that expanded during COVID. Organizations like First Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Sandtown-Winchester now distribute food six days a week.

**Undercovered**: How has food insecurity changed as pandemic-era programs ended? The Maryland Food Bank saw distribution increase 96% during COVID—where are those numbers now?

## Economic Development Stories

Several business-focused stories suggest angles:

**Small business ecosystem**: The ["Smalltimore" coverage](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/) examined how tight-knit business communities survive. Follow-up question: Which specific neighborhoods have seen small business growth or decline since that reporting?

**Port and shipping**: Beyond the Key Bridge story, the Port of Baltimore handles [significant cargo including autos and general cargo](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/26/the-history-of-baltimores-key-bridge/). How has trade patterns shifted?

**Meal-sharing economy**: An interesting [2019 piece on home-based eateries](https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/05/17/home-based-eateries-the-next-big-thing-in-the-sharing-economy/) raised regulatory questions. Has the city developed clearer policies? Are more food entrepreneurs using this model?

## Unfinished Stories and Ongoing Sagas

**Catherine Pugh scandal**: The former mayor [received three years for "Healthy Holly" fraud](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/02/27/ex-baltimore-mayor-gets-three-years-for-healthy-holly-fraud/) in 2020. She's likely out of prison now—what happened to her? Has the city recovered the restitution?

**Squeegee workers**: The city announced [a multi-tiered plan in 2022](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/10/baltimore-city-reveals-plan-for-controversial-squeegee-workers/). How's it working? Are conflicts down? Are workforce programs successful?

**Juvenile justice**: [Coverage noted concerns about juvenile crime](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/11/15/local-baltimore-residents-and-politicians-call-for-change-as-juvenile-crime-remains-high/) and calls for the removal of DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi. This situation may have evolved—verify current status.

**Preakness Stakes**: A [2019 story discussed possible relocation](https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/04/04/baltimore-businesses-brace-for-possible-preakness-move/) to Laurel Park. The race remained at Pimlico, but ongoing infrastructure concerns persist. This is a good anniversary story opportunity.

**Tax sale relief**: [Coverage from 2021 examined property tax sales](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/03/26/baltimore-city-residents-press-for-tax-sale-relief/) threatening low-income homeowners. Track whether pandemic-era protections remain or were made permanent.

## Reporting Tips Specific to Baltimore

**Access and trust**: Notice how many stories involve community leaders and neighborhood organizations rather than just official sources. People like [Nneka N'namdi of Fight Blight Bmore](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/working-to-reduce-blight-boost-business-in-baltimore/) or [Troy Staton of New Beginnings barbershop](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-barbershops-help-clients-cope-with-citys-senseless-violence/) provide crucial ground-level perspective. Build relationships with neighborhood leaders early.

**Historical context matters**: Baltimore's present can't be understood without acknowledging historical segregation and disinvestment. But avoid making every story a history lesson—find the contemporary angle while noting historical roots.

**Avoid savior narratives**: Many stories involve people helping their own communities. Don't frame outsiders as rescuers. When Kevin Plank opens a distillery or organizations provide aid, examine who actually benefits and how.

**Check multiple jurisdictions**: Baltimore City Police, Baltimore County Police, and Maryland State Police all operate in the area. City and county schools are separate systems. Always verify which jurisdiction you're covering.

## Sources to Cultivate

Based on the coverage, these types of sources provide valuable perspective:

- **Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA)**: Provides detailed neighborhood-level data
- **Neighborhood association leaders**: Each area has organized residents who track local issues
- **Faith leaders**: Churches play significant community roles, especially in food distribution and social services
- **Small business owners**: Provide economic ground truth
- **City Council members**: District representatives often have granular knowledge
- **Community health workers and trauma specialists**: Growing field in Baltimore
- **Port-adjacent businesses**: Truckers, warehouse operators, logistics companies

## Story Ideas Worth Pursuing

1. **Safe Streets funding cliff**: With federal cuts threatening the program, what happens to the six zones currently served? Can local funding replace federal dollars?

2. **Childcare desert mapping**: Both city and county saw provider declines. Create an interactive map showing childcare deserts and correlate with employment data.

3. **Infrastructure accountability series**: Track multiple ongoing projects (bridge rebuild, vacant property conversion, sewage system repairs) with a "promises vs. reality" framework.

4. **Climate and flooding**: Baltimore has aging infrastructure and increasing storm intensity. How are vulnerable neighborhoods preparing? Who pays when sewage backs up repeatedly?

5. **Food economy**: From meal-sharing apps to food deserts to mutual aid networks—Baltimore has multiple food systems operating simultaneously. Map the parallel economies.

6. **Digital divide persistence**: [A 2018 story noted 20% of households lack computers](https://cnsmaryland.org/2018/05/15/limited-resources-leave-many-baltimore-residents-digitally-challenged/). Has this improved? How did pandemic remote learning/work expose gaps?

7. **Youth advocacy follow-up**: Find the Frederick Douglass High School students who testified on the Healing City Act. Where are they now? Did the system change?

8. **Squeegee worker outcomes**: Two years after the controversial plan, track what actually happened to workers who entered training programs.

9. **Post-pandemic nonprofit health**: Many organizations expanded during COVID. Which survived? Which services contracted? Follow the money from CARES Act to present.

10. **Neighborhood comparison series**: Pick two adjacent neighborhoods with different trajectories (like Mondawmin and Belvedere). What policies, investments, or community actions explain diverging outcomes?

## A Final Word on Covering Baltimore

The clips reveal journalists who take time to understand context, listen to community voices, and avoid simplistic narratives. Baltimore resists easy storytelling—it's not just "troubled" or "resilient," but both simultaneously, in neighborhood-specific ways.

Your job is to report with nuance, track accountability, elevate community solutions, and maintain skepticism toward both politicians' promises and stereotypes about the city. The people here have seen plenty of journalists parachute in for crime stories. Earn trust by showing up consistently and treating Baltimore as a complex, living city rather than a backdrop for poverty porn or inspiration porn.

When Rep. Cummings died, people remembered him for being accessible and caring about regular constituents. That's a good model for coverage too. Show up, listen, follow through, and don't forget about stories after the press conference ends.
