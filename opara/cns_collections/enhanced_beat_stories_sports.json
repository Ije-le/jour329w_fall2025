    "summary": "The Little League World Series, a significant event for youth baseball athletes, has attracted larger TV audiences than some major league games, raising questions about the potential for young players to capitalize on their fame through NIL deals. However, Little League has not yet established clear policies regarding NIL for its young participants, citing the need to protect their eligibility for high school sports.",
    "content": "There\u2019s no bigger stage for a youth athlete than the annual Little League World Series, an international tournament for youth baseball stars every August in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.\nLast year\u2019s title game between the eventual champs Lake Mary, Florida, and Taoyuan, Taiwan, was a ratings winner attracting a larger average audience (3.5 million) than a major league game a week earlier in Williamsport between the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees (2.2 million).\nWhat if the 10-, 11- and 12-year-old stars of that Little League game wanted to use their newfound (and probably short-lived) celebrity to cut NIL deals with a local pizza parlor or a supermarket? Could they?\nThe answer isn\u2019t clear.\nFour years after NIL became a possibility for college and many high school players, Little League has yet to publish a policy for the two million boys and girls who are playing on diamonds in the U.S. and around the world.\nCapital News Service requested an interview with a Little League official to discuss the organization\u2019s position on NIL. Little League replied with a statement that reads in part: \u201cUntil the name, image, and likeness parameters are thoroughly determined for all amateur athletes below the college level, we will continue to maintain our current policies.\u201d\nIn a follow-up email, CNS requested clarification of Little League\u2019s \u201ccurrent policies\u201d on NIL.\nA Little League spokesperson responded with a statement that said Little League \u201cfeels its role is to protect the young athlete\u2019s eligibility for high school sports in baseball and softball.\u201d It did not address whether Little League has a NIL policy.\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nThere are indications that Little League discourages players participating in the World Series and elsewhere from participating in NIL.\nA document posted on Little League Baseball International\u2019s website titled \u201cAPPEARANCE OF LITTLE LEAGUERS\u201d notes that children who are \u201cidentified as Little Leaguers, either verbally or by inference, MUST NOT appear in any creative, non-news story form of media, television, print, social, or otherwise, in videos (other than home videos for personal use, and not to be sold).\u201d These restrictions would seem to rule out NIL.\nJonathan Anderson, coach of Lake Mary\u2019s championship team, told CNS that he was informed by a Little League official during the World Series that NIL was not permitted. Asked if he would favor Lake Mary players pursuing NIL deals, Anderson replied: \u201cNo, because Little League does not support it.\u201d\nWhether Little Leaguers, even stars of the annual World Series, would attract interest for NIL deals is not clear.\nPlayers in the World Series aren\u2019t even teenagers yet. There are limits to the marketing campaigns that they could be involved in or the influence they might have over consumers.\nAlso, their stardom fades quickly. The Lake Mary players were heroes in their hometown near Orlando after outlasting their Taiwanese opponents in extra innings for the title. They were guests of honor at Disney World and invited to throw out the first pitch at a Tampa Bay Rays game. That was after they drove through town in a parade. But a week later they were back to middle school and their normal lives.\nOn the other hand, the fame of the 12 Lake Mary players has grown in ways that seem to be sticking especially on social media. On Instagram, one player, JJ Feliciano, has more than 3,000 followers. The Lake Mary Little League Instagram account has more than 4,500 followers and posts concerning the Little League World Series winning team have routinely earned more than 150 likes.\n\nIn the years before NIL, there occasionally have been players in the World Series who appeared to have the star power and marketability to help companies pitch their products.\nIn 1971, Lloyd McClendon on a team from Gary, Indiana, hit home runs in five consecutive at bats. McClendon later played eight seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nIn 2014, Mo\u2019ne Davis was a media sensation when she became the first girl to earn a win and pitch a shutout in the Little League World Series. Davis was such a big star that she made it to the cover of Sports Illustrated with the caption: \u201cMo\u2019ne: Remember Her Name.\u201d\n\u201cShe was incredibly popular and well known for a short period of time, so I\u2019m guessing brands that would want to be affiliated with a young female star would have flocked to her,\u201d said Greg Abel, CEO of Abel Communications in Baltimore. Abel added that he would not be surprised if there are opportunities in the near future for Little Leaguers \u201cwith an interesting backstory.\u201d\nLittle League isn\u2019t the only national youth sports organization that appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to NIL. Pop Warner Little Scholars, the largest youth football, dance and cheer organization in the US with more than 400,000 participants, does not have a policy addressing NIL.\nThe organization, which suits up football players as young as five years old, isn\u2019t likely to have an NIL policy soon, according to Tim Glase, Chief Operating Officer of Pop Warner Scholars. \u201cBroadly speaking, I don\u2019t anticipate anything in the near future\u201d he said.\nPop Warner generally discourages its leagues from highlighting the touchdown passes and open-field tackles of its star players. That is in keeping with its philosophy of promoting teamwork over individual accomplishments. The organization also discourages its member leagues from collecting statistics on individual players, said the Pop Warner official\nBut trying to control NIL would be far more difficult, Glase said, noting: \u201cThe reality of it is, we can\u2019t really police things that happen outside of the sport of football or the sport of cheer and dance.\u201d",

High school officials and administrators are concerned about how NIL might be altering the landscape of student-athlete recruitment and retention.",
    "content": "A star basketball recruit moves from one top high school program to another in the Washington D.C. area, just before the start of the school year. Two more top prospects leave Alabama for Georgia.\nNone of these transfers has been explicitly tied to Name, Image and Likeness. But NIL and its impact on high school athletics hangs over all of them.\n\u201cA lot of this is hearsay but \u2026 it is changing the way that people get recruited,\u201d said Dan McMahon, principal at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville for the last 25 years.\nDeMatha, with 41 men\u2019s basketball conference championships, is known for holding on to talented players. The Stags\u2019 highly rated boys\u2019 basketball team, which has had at least 20 alumni go on to careers in the National Basketball Association, recently felt the negative effects of an athlete transferring. In July 2024, the team lost a star player to St. Paul VI Catholic High School, a rival in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.\n\u201cHe transferred after summer league. We just got a note saying that [he was leaving],\u201d said McMahon, adding that he could not say whether NIL was a factor in the decision.\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nCapital News Service sought comment for this article from St. Paul VI Principal Tom Opfer, Head Basketball Coach Glenn Farello and Athletic Director Billy Emerson. CNS also contacted Diocese of Arlington Director of Media Relations Mary Shaffrey. All declined interview requests.\nCompensation from NIL falls into two main categories, money from sponsorships which includes payment to an athlete for promoting a product or brand on social media and money from collectives, which are organizations that raise money from donors and distribute it to athletes in part to attract talented ones to their schools. Collectives are not allowed at the high school level.\nWCAC commissioner Dwayne Foster told CNS that he is not aware of a school in the conference that has formed a collective. Foster noted that collectives are prohibited in the states in which the schools in the WCAC are located and that an investigation would ensue should any breach of the rules be brought to light.\n\u201cYou have to have something tangible to be investigated,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe don\u2019t chase ghosts in that space.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to have something tangible to be investigated. We don\u2019t chase ghosts in that space.\u201d\n\u2014 Dwayne Foster, WCAC commissioner\n\nThe threat of losing talented athletes isn\u2019t exclusive to conference rivals. It also affects programs in states that don\u2019t allow NIL.\nDelaware\u2019s policy allowing high school athletes to capitalize on NIL took effect in October 2024, but bordering states have had NIL policies in place longer.\n\u201cIt would be naive not to think that there was a potential that some student athletes may try to transfer to a surrounding state,\u201d said Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association Executive Director David Baylor.\n\nAlabama is one of nine states that does not allow high school athletes to participate in NIL deals. Neighboring states including Georgia allow high school NIL.\n\u201cI may be old fashioned, but I truly believe high school students should play for the love of the game,\u201d said Steve Savarese, the Alabama High School Athletic Association\u2019s former executive director.\nAlabama state Rep. Jeremy Gray, a former college football player at N.C. State, supports allowing NIL deals for high school athletes. (Courtesy of Jeremy Gray campaign)\nSavarese\u2019s view of NIL contrasts with the position of Alabama state Rep. Jeremy Gray, a former college football player at N.C. State whose district includes his hometown of Opelika, a two-hour drive from Birmingham. Gray is a supporter, saying he is concerned that some families in Alabama may choose to leave the state to pursue NIL. He noted that three student athletes have left Alabama recently to pursue opportunities in other states including Georgia and Virginia and possibly were influenced by NIL policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for Alabama to reassess its stance. By doing so, Alabama can support its young athletes,\u201d Gray said.\nAlabama isn\u2019t alone in debating the future of NIL. In North Carolina, a court ruling in October 2024 paved the way for public schools to permit NIL deals. Private schools in the state are governed by a different association and were allowed to receive NIL prior to the ruling.\nMike Ingersoll, a lawyer who has represented high school players in NIL-related cases said that he represents clients in NIL cases for high school athletes in part because \u201cit can help them learn how to handle financial situations, something that a lot of professional athletes struggle with,\u201d\nOne Ingersoll client is quarterback Faizon Brandon, rated the No. 1 player in the 2026 high school class by 247Sports.com. Brandon, who attends Grimsley High School in Charlotte, has committed to play football at the University of Tennessee. Before the court ruling, he was not permitted to participate in NIL.\nIngersoll called North Carolina\u2019s policy \u201cvery inconsistent,\u201d noting that \u201cthe No. 1 high school football player in North Carolina for the class of 2026 couldn\u2019t receive NIL because he goes to a public school.\u201d Just days after the court ruling, Faizon signed a multi-year deal with Leaf Trading Cards.",

In the eyes of some business owners, it\u2019s new and untested. Return on investment is uncertain, but they don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity.\n\u201cThey might be looking to generate leads or direct sales or new visibility for the brand,\u201d said Bill Carter, founder of Student-Athlete Insights which advises athletes and their families about NIL.\nCarter, who is a member of the advisory board of the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism, noted that social media is the top priority for companies when deciding which athletes to engage in NIL deals.\n\u201cNine times out of 10, or eight times out of 10, what they\u2019re really looking for is some form of consumer engagement,\u201d he said, adding that NIL often provides a cost-effective way for companies to reach customers on social media.\nWater-resistant bag and accessory brand Portland Gear was responsible for the first high-school NIL deal in the state of Oregon. (Mark Hyman/Capital News Service)\nCompanies that have signed high school athletes to NIL deals range from national brands (Nike, Adidas, Puma, Gatorade) to smaller companies. In Oregon, Portland Gear, an apparel brand, signed high school basketball stars Sofia Bell and Jackson Shelstad to NIL deals in 2022 when they were seniors. At the time, both had committed to playing at the University of Oregon. In a press release, Portland Gear said it was \u201cthe first brand in the state\u201d to do an NIL deal with a high school athlete.\nLeaf Trading Cards, based near Dallas, has deals with 50 to 60 high school athletes, according to company president Josh Pankow. Leaf produces cards for each player and distributes them in packs found in stores nationwide.\nHigh school players working with Leaf include California\u2019s trailblazing football player Bella Rasmussen, one of just 359 girls playing 11-person football in the state (compared to 90,000 boys) as well as recent top quarterback prospects Jaden Rashada, Julian Lewis and Trae Taylor.\n\u201cNIL really became an opportunity to go after some of these kids before they were huge stars, so that we could build relationships with them, get to know them, get to know their family,\u201d Pankow told Capital News Service.\n\n\u201c NIL really became an opportunity to go after some of these kids before they were huge stars.\u201d\n\u2014Josh Pankow, president, Leaf Trading Cards\n\nWhile Leaf\u2019s current marketing strategy primarily targets highly-ranked quarterbacks, Pankow believes the evolution of NIL will induce a trickle-down effect for players with less national attention.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep up with [high school stats].

    "content": "As the number of state high school athletic associations that allow Name, Image and Likeness deals for athletes has grown, the need for NIL education seemingly has grown as well.\nYet in all but a few states, players and families are on their own to learn how they can benefit from NIL or perhaps lose athletic eligibility if they make a mistake.\nBill Carter, founder of Student-Athlete Insights, an NIL consultancy that is retained by high school associations and university athletic programs, said that high schools take the position that, while they permit NIL, it is not their responsibility.\n\u201c[Schools] can essentially say, \u2018We have nothing to do with this,\u2019\u201d said Carter, whose firm is based near Burlington, Vermont. \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem and somebody\u2019s going to get in trouble, the rules have been written in a way that would indicate that the coaches, the schools and the ADs are not going to get in trouble.\u201d\nParents \u2014 who must negotiate on behalf of their children under age 18\u2014 may be unaware of details of policies such as whether athletes can use school facilities in photos that appear in social media or penalties they face if they break rules.\nOf the 42 athletic associations (41 states plus Washington, D.C.) permitting NIL deals for high school students, the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found only a few that require or even encourage education.\n\nNorth Carolina has an education requirement.

    "content": "Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) is more the rule than the exception in high school sports. In 41 states and the District of Columbia, high school associations permit athletes to be compensated for appearing in advertisements and for using social media to pitch products. Four additional states permit NIL on a highly restricted basis.\n\nAn analysis by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland reveals a patchwork approach to regulating NIL.\nIn notable ways, state athletic association policies are similar, even identical. All prohibit mentioning an athlete's school or team as part of an NIL deal. They also prevent athletes from signing professional contracts or receiving performance-based incentives while participating in high school sports.\nSimilarly, over half of the current NIL-permitting state associations explicitly prohibit entering endorsement deals related to tobacco and alcohol products. Other commonly cited prohibited categories pertain to cannabis, lottery and sports gambling, weapons, adult entertainment and prescription pharmaceuticals.\nHigh school NIL rules, though similar from state to state, diverge in important, sometimes unexpected ways. Some notable differences include deal reporting requirements to athletic and academic administrators (or a lack thereof) and an athlete\u2019s ability to collect compensation earned in the Olympic Games.\nIn the four states in which NIL is highly restricted, including Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri, athletes must navigate rules such as being eligible for NIL only after signing a letter of intent to a college or university in that state.\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nState-specific variations in NIL reporting regulations\nOnly five of the 42 NIL-permitting athletic associations \u2014 Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia \u2014 specify when an athlete must report entering an NIL deal to a school administrator.\nGeorgia allows the most time, requiring an athlete, parent or guardian to notify a school principal or athletic director within seven days. Arizona requires the student or guardian to inform the school\u2019s athletic director within five school days.\nPennsylvania, Delaware and Virginia require notification within 72 hours of signing a deal. Only Virginia requires a principal or athletic director to be notified in writing. The District of Columbia State Athletic Association also requires written notification but does not offer a reporting deadline.\nThere are also differences among states regarding the involvement of a parent or guardian in NIL deals or for a school to be notified. For example, most NIL-permitting states, including California, Florida and New York, do not specify that athletes or their guardians must notify athletic, school or state administrators of entering an NIL agreement.\nJust nine NIL-permitting states share guidelines mandating some degree of notification to administrators. Those include the five states that demand timely notification of NIL agreements, as well as Oregon, Connecticut, North Carolina and Massachusetts.\nInstead of giving explicit directions, states such as Iowa encourage parents and athletes to receive outside legal counsel and tax advice. Iowa also recommends that those parties seek guidance from the athlete\u2019s member school.\n\nHow five states handle NIL violations\nThe most common forms of punishment faced by players who break NIL rules include potential loss of amateur eligibility, obligations to return earned funds, and suspension from athletic participation.\nSchools can be sanctioned, too.\nFive states \u2014 California, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, South Carolina and Florida \u2014 use three-strike policies with escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Of the five, only Pennsylvania suspends the offending athlete on their first violation.\nFlorida is also the only state among those that includes penalties for schools, employees and contractors, and it contains language specifically about \u201cfalsifying information\u201d related to NIL deals.\nOperation Gold: Evolving rules for Olympic-bound athletes\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, six high school athletes joined the ranks of Team USA to compete on the world stage.\nPreviously, amateur athletes competing in the Olympics often waived monetary prizes earned from competition to maintain their amateur status. Six states have amended their NIL and amateurism guidelines, enabling high school athletes to be paid by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee\u2019s Operation Gold program.\nConnecticut, Wyoming, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania created exceptions to allow high school athletes to collect Operation Gold funds.\nTexas, which currently prohibits high school NIL, also permits athletes to accept funds \u201cadministered by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) or other national governing body.\u201d\nAlaska, an NIL-permitting state, waived amateurism restrictions for athletes \u201cparticipating as members of official United States Olympic Teams,\u201d but did not include guidelines for compensation earned from participation at that level of competition.\nExpanding NIL opportunities: Digital assets and instructional roles\nAlthough states generally agree on permitted NIL categories, Maryland, Vermont, North Carolina and Massachusetts allow their athletes to promote non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which serve as digital ownership certificates for assets such as artwork or collectibles, including trading cards.\nHosting youth training camps or instructional clinics is another alternative to traditional NIL activities. But states remain divided on their use. For example, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina are among several states that permit athletes to participate in coaching or officiating opportunities if their earnings do not violate school-affiliated NIL restrictions.\nNew Jersey, an NIL-permitting state, deviated from its peers by banning its athletes from running or profiting from sports camps. This policy prevents NIL opportunities from extending into paid instructional roles.\nHoldouts and the road ahead\nHigh school state athletic associations across mostly southeastern states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi and North Carolina have approved NIL activities within the last two years, leaving only ten states as holdouts nationwide.\nThe most notable holdout is Texas, with over 850,000 high school athletic participants during the 2023-24 school year, ranking it first among states, according to figures from the 2023-24 National Federation of State High School Associations Participation Survey, a leading advocacy nonprofit for high school athletics.\n\nThe Midwest is the region with the largest number of remaining NIL-prohibiting states \u2014 Michigan, Indiana and Ohio \u2014 while the rest include West Virginia, Wyoming, Montana, Alabama and Hawaii.\nAs of May 2025, athletic associations and legislatures in these states are still divided on adopting NIL at the high school level.\nFor example, the Michigan House of Representatives passed HB 4816 in 2023, voting to extend NIL privileges granted to college athletes to high schoolers. The bill has comprehensive guidelines for permitted and prohibited NIL activities and requirements to provide notice of entering NIL agreements to a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) representative. Yet, the bill still awaits a vote in the Michigan Senate and, as a result, NIL activities remain banned by the MHSAA.\nIn January, the Montana High School Association approved an amended bylaw permitting athletes to profit from NIL. Whether the new rule goes into effect depends on approval from the Montana Legislature.\n\nConsensus and clarity regarding these policies are even more imperative as the United States experiences its highest high school athletic participation totals.",

    "summary": "California's Fair Pay to Play Act has expanded to allow high school athletes in 41 states and Washington, D.C. to earn money from their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), sparking debate over the professionalization of high school sports and potential unintended consequences.",
    "content": "On Sept. 1, 2021, California enacted a law that changed sports forever.\nThe Fair Pay to Play Act gave athletes playing for California universities the right to earn money from their Name, Image and Likeness. For the first time, they could retain their eligibility to play sports while being paid for signing an autograph, posting on social media and pitching a product.\nThree years later, college players across the country are cashing in \u2014 and so are high school athletes.\nWhere are high school NIL deals allowed?\nIn 41 states and Washington, D.C., any high school player \u2014 from a quarterback to a soccer goalie \u2014 can have an NIL deal. A few other states permit NIL on a highly restricted basis \u2014 Arkansas permits it only for high school athletes who have been accepted into an Arkansas college or university.\nSoon, NIL could be the rule in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nA record eight million athletes played high school sports in the 2023-24 academic year, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). With that large number of athletes comes a wide range of opinions on whether NIL is positive for high school athletics.\n\u201cI truly believe that most high school students, or a lot of students, should play for the love of the game,\u201d said Steve Savarese, who served as the Alabama High School Athletic Association Director from 2007 to 2021. \u201cOnce you receive compensation for your participation in sport, it becomes a degree of professionalism.\u201d\nProponents of NIL, on the other hand, say that high school athletes are entitled to profit from the acclaim that follows them.\nSports economist Andy Schwarz, a co-sponsor of the Fair Pay to Play Act, said withholding those rights from high school players reflects an \u201cun-American\u201d viewpoint.\n\u201cIt only makes sense [to deny NIL deals] if you believe that it\u2019s fundamentally bad to earn a living,\u201d Schwarz told Capital News Service.\n\nSavarese predicts a list of \u201cunintended consequences\u201d if NIL comes to Alabama, most of which would be damaging to high school sports. That includes the potential neglect of girls\u2019 sports, which he believes would result from heightened attention for football and boys\u2019 basketball.\n\u201cIn our state \u2014 the football-crazy state we live in \u2014 the football programs will always have money,\u201d Savarese said. \u201cOur other sports, our female athletes, our female programs, if money is given to individuals rather than the entire program at a school, I think there could be those unintended consequences.\u201d\nWyoming, which has 21,213 high school athletes according to NFHS, also does not permit NIL, although attitudes are changing.\nIn an interview with Capital News Service, Trevor Wilson, commissioner of the Wyoming High School Activities Association, said he strongly opposed NIL four years ago but has since done a \u201c180\u2026on this whole thing.\u201d Wilson said he now sees value in high schoolers learning how to earn money to help pay for books, tuition or other minor expenses.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can come up with something that\u2019s fair and makes sense for our students, and they don\u2019t get put in a bad spot,\u201d Wilson said.\nWyoming hardly would be alone in reevaluating NIL. In 2024, at least eight state high school athletic associations changed their rules to allow NIL. (No state that has adopted NIL has reversed course to prohibit it.)\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nNational poll shows majority support high school NIL\nJust four years after the first NIL deals \u2014 and three years after Nike signed its first high school athletes \u2014 most Americans seem to accept the idea of high school athletes as endorsers and influencers.\nA 2023 national poll conducted by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism, The Washington Post, and the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement at the University of Maryland revealed that 54% of Americans believe that high school athletes should be allowed to earn money through endorsement deals. Support was higher among respondents who are Black (74%) and Hispanic (73%).\nIn the poll, support for NIL for children before high school came to less than 50% overall. A majority of Black and Hispanic respondents, however, said they were in favor of pre-high school NIL, with 60% of Black respondents and 56% of Hispanic respondents approving of it.\nSchwarz, who has written extensively about sports, economics, and athlete rights, said that the differing viewpoints reflects a long-standing \u201cprejudice against athletes making money.\u201d\n\u201cIf a particular financial benefit feels like it goes disproportionately to minorities, we\u2019re oddly against it in America,\u201d he said.\nLack of data makes impact of NIL hard to determine\nThe impact of NIL on high school sports is unclear. That\u2019s due in part to a shortage of data \u2014 no national organization comprehensively tracks NIL at the high school level.\nThe NFHS has record-keeping on sports participation. It can tell you how many girls are playing 11-player football in Alaska (five). But it does not track NIL policies. Dan Schuster, NFHS Learning Center Director, explained that the organization \u201cis not in the requirements business.\u201d\n\u201cThe state athletic or activities associations, they\u2019re the ones that really make the requirements or don\u2019t make the requirements,\u201d Schuster said.\nNIL activity also is not tracked closely by state associations. All 50 states have at least one athletic association that makes policies for high school athletes. Rules about reporting NIL deals vary across those associations.\nAn analysis by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism revealed that no two state NIL policies are the same. Some span more than a page of the association\u2019s handbook, some are a few sentences and some associations have no NIL language in their policies.\n\nMore than half of all states explicitly prohibit NIL deals with companies that sell drugs, gambling or firearms, while others include language that seems to rule out these categories, but the language is not uniform.\nPenalties for breaking NIL rules also are far from standard. Some states have three-strike systems, meaning that a third violation generally results in the athlete losing their eligibility to play sports for their high school. Other state associations have adopted a zero-tolerance stance \u2014 one violation and the athlete is penalized. A few states that allow NIL appear to have no published rules for punishing violators.\nHigh school stars can rake in dollars with NIL deals\nA policy common among most states that permit NIL is a ban on athletes using school intellectual property in their NIL work, including team uniforms and logos. Most do not allow players to be pictured on school property for their promotional work. For instance, an athlete may sign a contract to appear in a commercial for the local restaurant, but the commercial could not be filmed on the team\u2019s home field and they could not wear their game jersey. The commercial could not include any clips from league-sanctioned games or feature a cameo from the school mascot.\nStill, the sheer magnitude of deals with some of the biggest pre-college names in the country have led to publicity for the schools where those players compete, even if no state policies were violated.\nAs state high school associations regulate NIL, elite athletes are pulling in dollars that only a few years ago would have been reserved for top pro athletes. Lakers guard Bronny James, whose superstar father LeBron has played 22 seasons in the NBA, signed a reported multi-million dollar deal with Nike when he was a senior at Sierra Canyon School in Los Angeles. Cameron Boozer, son of former NBA All-Star Carlos, who has committed to attend Duke University in the fall, has a NIL valuation of $1.6 million according to college and high school sports media website On3.com.\nJulian \u201cJuJu\u201d Lewis, ranked 12th on ESPN\u2019s list of the top 300 football recruits nationwide for the class of 2025, cashed in as a high school player in Georgia by signing a deal with Leaf Trading Cards, a Dallas-based trading card company. Not long after, Lewis brought attention to the brand by displaying one of his signed cards during an interview on The Pat McAfee Show, a widely watched sports interview and commentary program..\n\u201cNIL really became an opportunity to go after some of these kids before they were huge stars, so that we could build relationships with them, get to know them, get to know their family,\u201d Leaf President Josh Pankow told CNS.\nLeaf has agreements with 50 to 60 high school athletes, Pankow said. They include recent top quarterback prospects Jaden Rashada, Trae Taylor and Lewis. Leaf also made a deal with Bella Rasmussen, a star female football player in California who graduated high school in 2023.\nStill, high school NIL is in its infancy. In the 2023 Povich Center-Washington Post-CDCE survey, only 7% of respondents said they had seen a high school athlete endorse a product or service on TV or social media. The percentage of athletes with such deals is low, though tracking of NIL in high schools is inexact.\nDan McMahon, principal at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, said that of the roughly 650 students playing on sports teams, he is aware of just two who have had NIL deals. One was the star quarterback during the 2024 season for the Stags\u2019 football team, a perennial power in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference. The student, Denzel Gardner, is committed to playing football in the fall at the University of Southern Mississippi.\nMcMahon sees a future in which NIL gains momentum and more DeMatha players have deals. \u201cMy guess is in two years, that number will be eight or 10 kids. And two years after that\u2026..\u201d",

Despite facing challenges, Moore effectively exploited the Chiefs' defensive weaknesses, particularly through quarterback Jalen Hurts' running ability and precise passing to A.J.",
    "content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2013 In the leadup to Super Bowl LIX, Kellen Moore\u2019s presumed next stop was the worst-kept secret in the NFL.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 offensive coordinator is bookmarked to be the head coach of the New Orleans Saints, per multiple reports. Sunday likely served as his opening audition in the Superdome, his soon-to-be home stadium \u2014 and he aced it.\nMoore, 36, called a superb game against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Eagles\u2019 40-22 win in the championship game. He attacked the Chiefs\u2019 weak points and remained aggressive, setting up Philadelphia to succeed against a strong Kansas City defense.\n\u201cThe best part about Kellen\u2019s offensive genius is that we had two weeks to really set up a game plan that has an answer for everything [Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve] Spagnuolo has,\u201d offensive tackle Jordan Mailata said.\nPhiladelphia\u2019s offensive talent is undisputedly elite. The roster features six first-round picks and four second-round picks. But they looked broken in the final stretch of the 2023 season, scoring just 18.9 points per game in their last seven contests.\nPrized offseason pickup Saquon Barkley, who won the 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year award, deserves a lot of praise for the Eagles\u2019 rebound. But Barkley rushed for just 2.3 yards per carry in the Super Bowl, and Moore had to move off his top weapon.\n\u201cThey took away our bread and butter, but we were able to find a way which is hard to do against [the Chiefs],\u201d offensive tackle Lane Johnson said.\nMoore didn\u2019t even bother testing Kansas City\u2019s front. Instead, he trusted quarterback Jalen Hurts to make difficult throws outside the hashes, attacking the Chiefs\u2019 corners, including top defensive back Trent McDuffie, who has rarely been targeted this season. And Hurts succeeded, finding A.J. Brown in key moments.\n\u201cExplosive passes, the energy and how it brought the crowd out, it\u2019s just the shift of things,\u201d McDuffie said.\nMoore also exploited one of Kansas City\u2019s few defensive weaknesses \u2014 the quarterback run. Hurts rushed 11 times for 72 yards and a touchdown.\nPhiladelphia\u2019s offensive play-caller was cast aside by the Dallas Cowboys after the 2022 season despite leading one of the top-scoring offenses in the league. After a one-year stint with the Chargers, Moore joined the Eagles in 2024 and led an offensive resurgence. Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley both had career seasons under Moore, and Philadelphia entered Sunday averaging 27.2 points per game.\nAfter this season, Moore can leave on his own terms \u2014 unless he decides to do the unexpected and \u201crun it back\u201d with the Eagles, as head coach Nick Sirianni implored him with a laugh during the Super Bowl trophy presentation.\nPhiladelphia defensive coordinator Vic Fangio also deserves his share of the praise for the team\u2019s victory. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was sacked six times and looked rattled in the pocket throughout the night. The Eagles pressured Mahomes on 47% of dropbacks without blitzing once in the first half, according to Next Gen Stats.\nMahomes\u2019 pick-six to Cooper DeJean midway through the second half epitomized the game. The Chiefs attempted to mitigate pressure with a designed roll-out, but Mahomes still had a rusher in his face before throwing the interception.\nEven with his team up multiple scores after the defensive touchdown, Moore didn\u2019t ease up. Before the first half was finished, Hurts found Brown for a 12-yard touchdown to push the Eagles ahead 24-0 entering the break.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have to do much because the defense was doing so well,\u201d Brown said.\nWith momentum on its side, Philadelphia coasted to an 18-point victory, a dominant performance from a forceful roster.\nIn New Orleans, Moore would step into a much different situation, as the Saints\u2019 roster does not have the depth or talent to match the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl-winning squad. Still, Sunday night provided a potential preview for fans of what Moore could do as a head coach.\nSam Jane is a junior at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

At the end of his life, football will be just a piece of what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nBooker\u2019s family helped lay the groundwork for his success. Ava Lias-Booker, his mother, is a partner in a Baltimore law firm and was named one of Woodward/White\u2019s \u201cBest Lawyers in America\u201d in 2001. His father, Earl Thomas Booker III, played football at the University of Wisconsin and is a financial consultant. Both will attend the Super Bowl on Sunday.\nThomas Booker shares a moment with then-Gilman football coach Tim Holley in 2017. Booker is now a defensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles. (Steve Ruark/Gilman School)\nA standout student-athlete at Gilman in Baltimore, Booker played five different positions for the Greyhounds\u2019 football team and was selected to the 2016 USA Today All-State first team. He also carried a perfect 4.0 grade point average. Ivy League schools courted Booker, but he decided to attend Stanford University.\nBooker thrived on Stanford\u2019s campus. He was a two-time team captain, made multiple appearances on All-Pac 12 teams and was a finalist for the 2021 William V. Campbell Trophy, awarded annually to the college football player with the best combination of academics, community service and on-field performance.\n\u201cIf 15 years from now, you called me and told me Thomas was the Democratic or Republican [nominee for president], I would not be surprised in the slightest,\u201d Holley said.\nIn the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis in 2020, Booker became a leading voice on Stanford\u2019s campus in the fight for social justice and racial equality. He helped found CardinalBLCK, a Stanford program designed to connect and support Black student-athletes.\nBooker also was a national co-chair of \u201cAthletes for Harris\u201d in support of Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign.\nIn addition to politics, Booker has devoted time to charitable work. He and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean \u2014 who called Booker a \u201cvery intelligent guy\u201d \u2014 worked with the nonprofit Leveling the Playing Field to sort and organize sports equipment donations.\n\u201cThomas doesn\u2019t just gravitate to an issue just to be out there. He has to feel he can really contribute to advancing the cause to get engaged,\u201d Lias-Booker said of her son. \u201cI think he relishes opportunities to be with the community.\u201d\nThomas Booker (#7) celebrates Senior Night for Gilman football with his family in 2017. The Maryland native is set to play in Super Bowl LIX with the Philadelphia Eagles. (Steve Ruark/Gilman School)\nBooker\u2019s off-field accolades and maturity were appreciated by NFL scouts ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft. But while the Houston Texans selected the defensive tackle in the fifth round, he was waived from the team just a year later.\n\u201cGetting cut [is] very objective. You\u2019re unemployed,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThis is just kind of what sports are, sometimes you just objectively lose and you have to figure out: Am I going to decide to quit or am I going to decide to keep on trying to master my craft?\u201d\nBooker, listed at 6-foot-3, 301 pounds, was signed to the Eagles practice squad soon after that, but he didn\u2019t appear in a game in 2023.\nPhiladelphia signed him to the active roster ahead of the 2024 season. He has appeared in every game for the Eagles, recording 1.5 sacks and 18 tackles. And he\u2019s expected to suit up again for Super Bowl Sunday.\nThrough it all, Booker\u2019s ties to Baltimore and to Gilman remain strong. Friends and family turned out when the Eagles beat the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium on Dec. 1. Last year, he attended his fifth high school reunion at Gilman, where his former classmates hadn\u2019t forgotten about him either.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking there are going to be a lot of Gilman Eagle fans on Sunday because of him,\u201d Holley said.\n\nMaryland native and Gilman graduate Thomas Booker on how cool it is to get some MD support this week. pic.twitter.com/nXIc1wa6RB\n\u2014 Sam Jane (@sam_jane230) February 6, 2025",

    "summary": "In a historic NFL game, Lamar Jackson's Ravens defeated Jayden Daniels' Washington Commanders, showcasing two exceptional Black quarterbacks and setting the stage for Daniels as a promising rookie. The increasing presence of Black starting quarterbacks in the NFL, with 15 in the 2024 season, marks a significant shift from past years, reflecting broader changes in the league's landscape.",
    "content": "In week 6 of the NFL season, football fans in the DMV got to witness an electric quarterback matchup.\nBaltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson and Washington\u2019s Jayden Daniels faced off in what ended up being one of the Ravens\u2019s highest attended regular season games in franchise history.\nThe rookie, Daniels, would end up passing for 269 yards and two touchdowns. Daniels also led his team in rushing with 22 yards. The reigning Most Valuable Player, Jackson, was a very efficient 20-26. He earned 323 yards, a touchdown, and the win.\nDaniels has finally given Washington fans a reason to feel optimistic and Jackson could be on the way to his third MVP award.\n\u201cFootball fans probably see an emerging quarterback who has shown signs of being great and a veteran quarterback in Lamar that has been great for a long time,\u201d said Jerry Bembry, senior writer for ESPN\u2019s Andscape.\nFor current fans, the prospect of two separate Black quarterbacks winning both the MVP and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year would not be surprising. But just 15 years ago, the very idea wouldn\u2019t have been realistic given the landscape of NFL quarterbacks at that time.\nWhen this NFL season kicked off in 2024, there was a new record set for the number of Black starting quarterbacks in a single week \u2013 15. That was up from 14 in 2023.\n\u201cIn the next three to four years, half of the quarterbacks in the league will be of color,\u201d said former Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams during a panel discussion with The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism in 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of their skin color, it\u2019s because they can play the position.\u201d\nWilliams was the first Black quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl. He, and future stars like Cam Newton and Russell Wilson, helped lay the foundation for Black quarterbacks of today.\nThey have created a new normal for young quarterbacks that look like them \u2013 including Malik Washington, starting quarterback at Archbishop Spalding High School in Severn, Md.\nMalik Washington stands in the pocket and delivers a pass. Washington has led Archbishop Spalding High School to three straight MIAA A Conference titles and is committed to play at the University of Maryland. (Photo Courtesy of Malik Washington)\nWashington, 18, had the opportunity to grow up watching the NFL where there were a handful of high-performing Black quarterbacks at the forefront.\n\u201cJust seeing the influx of us, being in the league, being the faces of teams \u2026 It\u2019s not something that has always been like that,\u201d said Washington, a four-star quarterback who is committed to play at the University of Maryland.\nBlack Quarterbacks in the NFL: The Early Years\nIn Major League Baseball, Jackie Robinson is widely recognized for his contributions to the sports of baseball, being credited as the man who broke the color barrier. However, in the NFL, the history isn\u2019t as clear cut.\n\u201cIn football, there\u2019s a lot of little moments, small progressions. One step forward, one step back and then another step forward,\u201d said John Eisenberg, longtime journalist and author of \u201cRocket Men: The Black Quarterbacks Who Revolutionized Pro Football.\u201d\nThe year 1953 proved to be an important one as Black NFL players would see their first action at quarterback. In October 1953, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) National champion Willie Thrower became the first Black man to get snaps at the quarterback position in two separate games. On Nov. 22, 1953, George Taliaferro became the first Black quarterback to start a NFL game.\nWillie Thrower was the first Black quarterback to play in the Big Ten. (Photo courtesy of the Michigan State University Archives & Historical Collections)\nFast forward 15 years, the NFL would see its first true Black starting quarterback when Marlin Briscoe started five games as a rookie in 1968. Despite a fairly successful season as a rookie quarterback, Briscoe would leave Denver to play for the Buffalo Bills where he transitioned into becoming a receiver.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until the 1980s where Black quarterbacks would see real, sustained success over a period of time. In 1984, Pro Football Hall of Famer Warren Moon was signed by the Houston Oilers. The very next year, the dynamic Randall Cunningham was selected as the first quarterback in the second round of the 1985 NFL Draft.\nThe Doug Williams Effect\nThe pinnacle of the progression of the Black quarterback came in 1988 when Doug Williams led Washington to a Super Bowl XXII victory.\nAlthough Washington, D.C. is known as \u201cChocolate City\u201d, the city\u2019s team was actually the last team to integrate.\n\u201cWashington, as a franchise, has a terrible history when it comes to race,\u201d said Eisenberg. \u201cGeorge Preston Marshall, who founded the franchise, he was the descendant of Confederate officers. He was just an outright racist. He did not want Black players on his team.\u201d\nWashington eventually did integrate in 1962. Twenty-six years later, Williams would alter the perception of what was possible for Black quarterbacks in the NFL.\nAs President Ronald Reagan looks on, Doug Williams speaks at a 1988 ceremony to congratulate the Super Bowl XXII winners, the Washington Redskins, on the south lawn of the White House. (Photo from the National Archives)\n\u201cWhen [Williams] won the Super Bowl, that really set us on the trajectory of, you know what, black quarterbacks can really make it in this league, and they can win at the highest level,\u201d said Bembry of Andscape. \u201cI think Black quarterbacks have proven that they have a place, they can be the best in this game.\u201d\nHowever, the progression of success for Black quarterbacks in the NFL wasn\u2019t linear.\n\u201cI covered that Super Bowl for the Baltimore Sun,\u201d added Eisenberg. \u201cAfter [Williams] won, everyone thought, \u2018Oh well, great! This is great. Everything is going to change.\u2019 But the next, I believe, 25 Super Bowls were won by white quarterbacks.\u201d\nSteve McNair out of Alcorn State, a historically Black university in Mississippi, was drafted by the Titans third overall in the 1995 NFL Draft. McNair is still the highest drafted offensive player from a historically Black college in the history of the NFL Draft.\nMcNair took the Titans to the Superbowl in 2000 and was the first Black quarterback to be named NFL MVP when he shared the award with Peyton Manning in 2003.\nBut the 2010s would be where NFL fans would truly see the type of impact Black quarterbacks could have on the game.\nA Turning Point for Black QBs\nThe 2011 NFL Draft brought in both Cam Newton and Colin Kaepernick.\nNewton, the first overall pick, was the first rookie to throw for 400 yards in his NFL debut and he was also the first rookie in NFL history to pass for 4,000 yards. In 2015, Newton would have one of most dominant seasons in league history.\nKaepernick had an impressive start to his football career \u2013 taking the 49ers to a Super Bowl in his second year \u2013 before facing backlash for taking a stand against racial injustice. (He would eventually file a grievance with the NFL over the issue and reach a settlement.)\nColin Kaepernick, San Francisco 49ers quarterback, rockets a pass to wide receiver Anquan Boldin during a 2013 NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium, London. (Photo by U.S. Air Force 2nd Lt. Keenan Kunst)\nThe Seattle Seahawks drafted Russell Wilson in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft and it led to immediate success. The Seahawks won Super Bowl XLVIII in Wilson\u2019s second season as a NFL starter.\n\u201cCam Newton, Russell Wilson, Colin Kaepernick and Robert Griffin III all came into the league within two years,\u201d said Eisenberg. \u201cFor the first time, those guys came in and teams said, \u2018we\u2019re going to let you be you.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cRussell Wilson won a Super Bowl. Kaepernick [and Newton], they were all in the Super Bowl in their first four or five years. That just threw the door open wide for the Black quarterback who may have been denied opportunity,\u201d Eisenberg added.\nThe Position Today\nThe past eight years has ushered in a new vanguard of elite quarterbacks.\nPatrick Mahomes has won three Super Bowls, three Super Bowl MVPs and two regular season MVPs in just eight seasons.\nSuper Bowl LVII at the conclusion of the 2023 NFL season would end up being the first Super Bowl in which two Black quarterbacks faced off against each other. Although Jalen Hurts had one of the best performances in Super Bowl history with 374 total yards and four touchdowns, he would fall short to Mahomes.\nLamar Jackson\u2019s resume also speaks for itself.\nAs for Washington\u2019s NFL team, Doug Willliam\u2019s Super Bowl victory didn\u2019t immediately open the floodgates for Black quarterbacks, but the team has invested in Black quarterbacks as a franchise in the last two decades.\nIn 2005, Washington drafted Jason Campbell with the 25th overall pick. Robert Griffin III took the league by storm as a rookie in 2012, but his career would end up being hampered by injuries. Dwayne Haskins was selected with the 15th pick of the 2019 NFL Draft and now Jayden Daniels has taken over and has injected energy in D.C. that Washington fans haven\u2019t experienced in 12 years.\n\u201cJayden Daniels, the guy has been really exceptional,\u201d said Bembry. \u201cThe way he has transformed interest in this city with the NFL \u2026 the energy level, the interest level in this team has been tremendous, unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d\nNot only are teams investing in and building franchises around Black quarterbacks, but there are other signs of progress: even Black quarterbacks who aren\u2019t consistently starting and scoring have the backing of owners and fans.\nRussell Wilson, quarterback for the Denver Broncos, attends a Salute to Service Boot Camp as a member of the Denver Broncos in 2022. (U.S. Space Force photo by Airman 1st Class Aleece Williams)\nRussell Wilson was written off as \u201cwashed\u201d and \u201cover the hill\u201d, but now he is in Pittsburgh and has the Steelers in first place in the AFC North.\nThere are also Black backup quarterbacks that have their own cult followings and Pro Bowl accolades such as the Brown\u2019s Jameis Winston and Miami\u2019s Tyler Huntley.\nBlack quarterbacks are now getting second chances and have the freedom to mess up. They\u2019re not forced to switch positions or risk being a bench player for the rest of their career. They no longer have to be exceptional to get the support of coaches and upper management.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have some Black quarterbacks that come into [the NFL] and fail. You\u2019re going to have some white quarterbacks that will fail. But they were given the opportunity,\u201d said Williams during the University of Maryland panel.\nIt\u2019s something Malik Washington, the starting quarterback at Archbishop Spalding High School, has noticed, as well as experienced.\n\u201cGrowing up, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t the most athletic,\u201d said Washington. \u201cThere was really no other position for me to play but quarterback and then by the time the athleticism came, I already established myself as a quarterback. There was never really too many people who tried to push me one way or another.\u201d\nWashington takes inspiration from Jackson and Daniels, who he says persevered despite people pushing them \u201cto play the game in a different way.\u201d\n\u201cIt just kind of gives me an example to follow.\u201d",

Although the Ravens dropped their first two games in the season, \u2014 one to the defending champions, Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 they have since won three games in a row.\nJackson is tied for the third most total touchdowns in the NFL with nine passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns and only one interception to his name.

Daniels currently leads the NFL in completion percentage and has led his team to a 4-1 start, their best start since 2008.\nDaniels has added a couple of records to his resume only five games into his career, including being the first quarterback to have over 1,000 passing yards and 250 rushing yards in their first five games.\nThe 2023 Heisman winner and 2024 NFL Draft number two overall pick is also responsible for leading the Commanders to become the first team in the Super Bowl era to score at least 150 points in their first five games while starting a rookie quarterback. The Commanders currently have the number one offense in the NFL.\nBoth teams are committed to the run\nAs if Jackson was not enough to deal with, the Ravens picked up the 2020 Offensive Player of the Year Derrick Henry this offseason. Henry is currently tied for 13th in the NFL for total touchdowns with seven touchdowns. Henry has added a dominant, downhill running attack to an offense that already featured a dynamic quarterback like Lamar Jackson, who can get it done both through the air and on the ground.\nThe Commanders have a strong running attack as well, leading the NFL in total rushing touchdowns this season with 13.

But after being swept by the Boston Braves and facing incredible financial competition from the upstart Federal League, team owner Connie Mack parted ways with a number of star players, including multiple future Hall of Famers.\nIn 1916, Mack\u2019s team had a .235 winning percentage and were nicknamed \u201cthe Pathetics.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s oddly fitting that they\u2019re right there with the Pathetics,\u201d Kopf said of the Nationals. \u201cI\u2019m almost shocked they weren\u2019t worse.\u201d\nThe Nationals\u2019 fall was much different from the slide of the Athletics, who won their third World Series in four seasons in 1913. In the Nationals case, there was no new league poaching players and no individual moment of heartbreak that turned the tide of the success.\nInstead, a pandemic, injuries, a lack of aggressiveness to acquire proven talent and the wait for young talent to form a new core doomed the post-title Washington club.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t doing any of the things that you have to do to become competitive in any kind of short-to-medium-term time frame,\u201d said Michael Baumann, a writer for the baseball statistics and analysis site FanGraphs. \u201cThey weren\u2019t drafting particularly well. They weren\u2019t developing particularly well. They weren\u2019t signing free agents.\u201d\nThe Nationals declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe fall off\nBaumann called the Nationals 2020 season \u201cthe mother of all World Series hangovers.\u201d\nFollowing their title, the Nationals lost star third baseman Anthony Rendon to the Los Angeles Angels. Then, as a result of COVID-19, the season was shortened to just 60 games.\nThe one positive heading into that shortened season was the team had re-signed World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg to a seven-year, $245 million contract that practically ensured he would spend the rest of his career with the Nationals.\nThe team went 26-34, a .433 winning percentage, in the pandemic season and finished last in the National League East. Worst of all, Strasburg got hurt in his second start of the year.\nStrasburg was the top selection in the 2009 MLB Draft, and his debut in 2010 represented a new hope for a franchise that had yet to experience success. Despite battling injuries, Strasburg had been a three-time All-Star and finished fifth in National League Cy Young voting in 2019.\nWhen he entered free agency after the World Series, Strasburg, much like Rendon, had the option to ditch the Nationals for a bigger market. Instead, he chose to re-sign with Washington.\nAfter his injury in 2020, Strasburg only pitched six more games, making his final appearance in 2022 before officially retiring in April.\n\u201cHe wanted to be in D.C., which not very many people do,\u201d Kopf said. \u201cHe could have left for the Yankees and been a stud in New York and gotten way more money and fame, and he didn't. He wanted to stay here and it was sad to see that (injury).\u201d\nThe Nationals continued to struggle in 2021 and at the trade deadline, Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo orchestrated a fire sale. The centerpiece of the six trades Rizzo made was shipping Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, and 27-year-old shortstop Trea Turner, to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Both were instrumental in the Nationals\u2019 title run.\n\u201cYou could kind of tell they were running on fumes,\u201d Kopf said of the 2021 team.\nThe next year brought even more devastating news to Nationals fans: Rizzo traded Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres in August.\nSoto was 23 at the time of the trade and already a two-time All-Star.\nIn return, the Nationals, who also traded first baseman Josh Bell, acquired MacKenzie Gore, a 23-year-old rookie who was among the sport's most promising pitchers, as well as a trio of notable prospects: shortstop CJ Abrams, outfielder James Wood and Robert Hassell III, a first round pick in 2020. Luke Voit, a veteran first baseman/designated hitter and Jarlin Susana, an 18-year-old pitcher, were also in the deal.\n\u201cA lot of people at Baseball America who have experienced a lot more trades than me thought about this as one of the most impressive prospect hauls that we'd ever seen for a player,\u201d said Carlos Collazo, who covers the Major League Baseball draft and minor league prospects for Baseball America.\nWASHINGTON - Billboards show players CJ Abrams and MacKenzie Gore at Nationals Park. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/Capital News Service)\nWeeks before the trade, Soto reportedly declined a contract worth 15 years and $440 million from the Nationals. The $29.3 million annual average on that contract would rank 20th all-time today, according to Spotrac.\nSoto will be a free agent this offseason and is expected to sign a contract worth at least $500 million, according to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan. But, if it were up to Baumann, he\u2019d still be in D.C.\n\u201cI would have given him whatever he wanted,\u201d Baumann said. \u201cHe is just such a hard player to replace, and particularly at that age.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the Soto trade, the Nationals finished 2022 with 55 wins and a .340 winning percentage \u2014 the franchise\u2019s lowest since moving to Washington \u2014 and last in the NL East for the third consecutive season.\nIn those seasons the Nationals had a winning percentage of .380, the lowest all time for an MLB team in the three years following a championship.\n\nA lack of spending\nIn the years leading up to the World Series title, the Nationals were among the league\u2019s biggest spenders, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks professional sports spending and contracts.\nIn both 2015 and 2018, Washington had the fifth-highest player payroll in the MLB. The following two years, they had the seventh-highest payroll.\nAfter the World Series and the pandemic, there was a shift. The Nationals were shedding contracts via trade but not reinvesting in the team.\nThe Nationals dipped to 13th in spending in the MLB in 2021 and fell to 25th in 2023 before sitting at 24th this past season.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t dead last or second to last,\u201d Kopf said.\n\nA better tomorrow? \nAfter winning the World Series, the Nationals not only did not spend, but also lacked young impact players.\nRizzo tried to fix that with the barrage of trades in 2021, but the team has only seen a marginal payoff. Pitcher Josiah Gray, an All-Star in 2023, and catcher Keibert Ruiz \u2014 both acquired from the Dodgers in the Turner and Scherzer trade \u2014 have shown glimpses of being great players, but have lacked the consistency to realize their potential.\nThe Nationals won 71 games and had a .438 winning percentage for the second straight year in 2024, but avoided the NL East\u2019s basement for the first time since winning the World Series. A major reason is the players received from the Soto trade.\nGore has struggled with consistency, but has been incredible in spurts.\nThrough May, the 25-year-old lefty had a 2.91 ERA before seeing that number skyrocket in June and July. September has been Gore\u2019s best, as he posted a 1.26 ERA in the season\u2019s final month.\nAbrams was named an All-Star this season after hitting 15 home runs, stealing 15 bases and accruing an .831 on-base plus slugging percentage in the first half of the season.\nThe 23-year-old shortstop was significantly less productive in the second half of the season.\nAbrams was demoted to the minor leagues on Sept. 21, the day after Cody Delmendo of CHGO, a Chicago centric sports outlet, reported that Abrams was out at a casino all night, returning only hours before the team\u2019s afternoon game against the Chicago Cubs. When asked, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said Abrams was demoted due to an internal issue and declined to give media more specifics.\nWood could end up being a superstar. A 6-foot-7, 234-pound outfielder with the ability to be among the game\u2019s fastest players is a rarity.\n\u201cMy oldest daughter already knows who he is and could pick him out of a lineup,\u201d Kopf said.\nWood made his major league debut in July and had a .265 batting average with a .354 on-base percentage, with seven home runs and 41 RBIs in 79 games this season.\nIn addition to the talent from the Soto trade, Dylan Crews, the No. 2 selection in the 2023 draft, dashed through the minors and made his debut on Aug. 26. He was named the organization\u2019s minor league hitter of the year this year. He hit .270 with six triples, 13 home runs and 68 RBIs across Double and Triple-A before being called up to the majors.\n\u201cI think (the Nationals) are one of the more intriguing teams,\u201d Collazo said. \u201cJust given the quantity and quality of young, big-league talent they have that can take steps forward over the next few years.\u201d\nSince the elation of 2019, it's been a historically rough go for the Nationals and for fans like Kopf, but after floundering for half a decade, there might be promise for the future.\n\u201cThere's a number of people to get excited about,\u201d said Kopf, who tracks the progress of most of the team\u2019s top prospects online. \u201cEven beyond, (like) the Wood and the Crews, there's some people in the minors that are going to be good in a few years.\u201d",

Many key figures in African basketball, including coaches and officials, have connections to universities in the D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
    "content": "KIGALI, Rwanda \u2013 On June 1, African basketball fans packed DK Arena in Rwanda\u2019s capital city to witness the apex of the sport on their continent.\u00a0\nIt was the championship game of the Basketball Africa League, a league established by the NBA as a part of their mission to prioritize growing the game on the African continent.\nThe league is spearheaded by Amadou Gallo Fall, president of the BAL and one of the most important sports officials on the continent. That\u2019s the same Amadou Fall who was a standout center for the University of District of Columbia Firebirds from 1989 to 1993.\n\u201cI often refer to Amadou \u2013 and many others refer to him \u2013 as the godfather of basketball in Africa,\u201d NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum said. \u201cFrom the very beginning his story is so inspirational.\u201d\nBasketball in Africa has deep connections to the DMV. In addition to Fall, others with ties to the area include Roland Houston, Technical Director at NBA Academy Africa in Senegal who previously coached at George Washington and George Mason universities; Joe Toumou, Assistant Technical Director at NBA Academy Africa; Sidy Sall, a coach at NBA Academy Africa who recently joined the men\u2019s basketball coaching staff at Mount St. Mary\u2019s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland; Godwin Owinje, co-founder with Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri of the non-profit Giants of Africa; and Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, head of operations for the BAL.\u00a0\nOwinje, Boumtje-Boumtje and Toumou all played college basketball at Georgetown University.\u00a0\nFall, who was born in Senegal, began his journey to the DMV as a teenager. He attended a basketball camp that was run by a Peace Corps volunteer. The volunteer, from the D.C. area, quickly noticed Fall. He introduced him to George Leftwich, then UDC men\u2019s basketball coach. Eventually, that led to Fall joining the basketball team and graduating magna cum laude from UDC.\u00a0\n\u201cIn a nutshell it all started there [DC], it really opened my eyes to the power of sport and basketball,\u201d said Fall, who was inducted into the UDC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2019.\u00a0 \u201cYou have generations of people who have come from Africa living in the area. So definitely a place we\u2019re proud to have experienced.\u201d\nGeorgetown University\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team is at the center of many of the connections between African basketball and the DMV. John Thompson, the Hoyas\u2019 famed head coach from 1972 to 1999, was a pioneer in bringing African players to his team.\n\u201cI really forged a strong relationship with [Thompson],\u201d Fall said. \u201cIn so many ways the pipeline started\u201d at Georgetown.\nOne of those early Georgetown players was Godwin Owinje who grew up in Nigeria and began his college basketball career at Bismarck State, a junior college in North Dakota. After two years, Owinje moved to Georgetown for the 1995-96 season.\n\u201cThe only thing I knew about Georgetown was watching the basketball team on television. I thought it was an all-Black school, everybody on the team was Black,\u201d \u201d Owinje joked. \u201cThat was the biggest shock when I came to Georgetown.\u201d\nAfter leaving Georgetown, Owinje played six seasons of professional basketball overseas. Later, he returned to Prince George\u2019s County near Washington DC, where he and his childhood friend Ujiri were roommates.\nGodwin Owinje with Masai Ujiri, his longtime friend. Ujiri and Godwin are co-founder of Giants of Africa(Photo Courtesy of Godwin Owinje)\nIn their apartment, Ujiri and Owinje hatched the idea for Giants of Africa, a philanthropic organization that has worked to inspire and empower African youth. From its start in 2003, Giants of Africa has grown steadily and now operates basketball camps in 17 African countries and is building 100 outdoor courts throughout the continent.\u00a0\nOwinje, now a scout with the Brooklyn Nets, recalls that in the early days, \u201c It was kind of rough. We were determined to get something going. We used to do shoe drives to raise money. We called a bunch of college coaches to give us old shoes, that kind of stuff.\u201d\u00a0\nSeveral of the former players interviewed for this article recalled the challenges that they met when they moved from Africa to the DMV to pursue their basketball dreams.\u00a0\n\u201cThe first [culture shock] was the food, obviously very different from what I grew up with,\u201d said Boumtje-Boumtje who grew up in Cameroon.\u00a0 \u201cI had an American host family. The first meal [they served], half of it was sweet and the other half was salty.\u201d\nOwinje recalled that in his home country of Nigeria, basketball shoes were a luxury. \u201c\u201cGrowing up, I played in slippers. I played basketball barefooted,\u201d he said\n\u00a0If he wore a hole in his shoe, Owinje said, he would go to the local mechanic where he\u2019d pick up unused tires, cut out rubber pieces and tape them to fill the gap in the soles.\nUjiri and Owinje are among the players who came to the DMV as players and now are in executive and scouting roles in the NBA. A new generation of basketball players is following them. Owinje\u2019s son, Zoje, is a standout junior guard at Clinton Grace Christian School in Clinton, Maryland,\u00a0\nSall came to the DMV from Africa for a coaching opportunity. Part of his new job at Mount St. Mary\u2019s tasks him with recruiting local high school talent. The players he\u2019s meeting in the US are different from those he coached at NBA Academy Africa in many ways. A notable one is their height. The Academy\u2019s 2023 roster had eight players listed at six-ten or above. In contrast, the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, the DC area\u2019s premier high school basketball conference made up of eleven teams, currently has just four players in that category.\u00a0\n\u201cThe shortest guy we had [at NBA Academy Africa] was six-three. Around this area, probably the tallest guy you will see is six-eight or six-nine,\u201d Sall said.\nSidy Sall on the sidelines at NBA Academy practice in Senegal (Photo Courtesy of Sidy Sall)\nThere are similarities too. \u201cOur guys back home play hard. They all have that chip on their shoulder that they\u2019re trying to make it for their family,\u201d Sall said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing here. They\u2019re trying to make it to help themselves, get an education in college and help their families.\u201d\nFall, the BAL president, is committed to building more bridges between basketball in Africa and the DMV. His next goal: An exchange program for students with UDC, the university that launched his basketball career.",

    "content": "SALY, Senegal \u2013 Ten players, dressed in blue-and-white NBA Academy jerseys, took their positions on the court. They set up with five players on defense and five on offense, ready to work on their defensive sets, specifically how to defend a screen.\u00a0\nManuel Camboma drove to the right, his defender Mouhamed Camara yelled, \u201cIce! Ice!\u201d Camara forced Camboma to the left away from the screen, cutting off the option to use the screen. But in doing so he left an open lane to the basket, which Camboma took advantage of as he drove in and scored.\u00a0\nIt was a teaching moment.\u00a0\nAlfred Aboya, a coach at the Academy, stopped the play and reset. It was almost like rewinding a video, the same sequence playing out. Only this time, when Camara called, \u201cIce!,\u201d his teammate Paulino Mangar Majok slid into the gap, cutting off the lane to the basket.\nAt NBA Academy Africa, elite basketball players from the continent, ages 15 to 18 are recruited to come and train so that they can reach what they all hope for\u2014to play college basketball and then in the pros. For that to happen, their coaches believe they must have a strong Basketball IQ and master the fundamentals of the game.\nCamboma, who came to the Academy from Angola, said that in his home country, \u201cthey don\u2019t teach us how to play defense on screens, how to talk on defense, how to position yourself on defense,\u201d adding that, \u201cyou come here, you have to talk on defense. You got to learn how to defend the screen.\u201d\nCamara, who is from Senegal, said: \u201cBefore [arriving at the Academy]\u00a0 I think I\u2019m a great player. I can do whatever I want.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe has learned otherwise thanks to his coaches, he said. \u201cThey got patience. They teach me how to play basketball. How to learn the game more.\u201d\nPatience and repetition are keys at the academy, according to Roland Houston, the Academy\u2019s Technical Director who is in charge of all player development and coaching.\u00a0\nHouston noted that training at the Academy has been influenced by some of the teaching strategies popular in Europe like emphasizing practice time in the gym over playing just game after game. Houston referred to it as \u201cbeing in the laboratory.\u201d\u00a0\nThat method is showing results. According to the NBA, 64 European players were listed on opening-night rosters for the 2023-2024 season.\nThe method is also proving to be successful for Academy graduates as Seifeldin Hendawy and Khaman Maluach both committed to Division I colleges for the 2024-25 season\u2014Hendawy to Loyola Chicago and Maluach to Duke.\u00a0\nSeifeldin Hendawy (center, blue shirt) pulls up on the elbow after making a move past his coach during a practice drill. (Jenna Bloom/Capital News Service)\nAnd on June 28, 2024, Ulrich Chomche made history as he was the first NBA Academy alumni to be drafted to the NBA as the 57th overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.\nHouston laughed as he recounted one of the first times he drew up a play on a whiteboard at the Academy. In the huddle, he said all the players seemed to understand the play, but when they set up on the court there were guys all on the wrong side.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to happen is when a kid leaves us, he doesn\u2019t understand the [basketball] language\u2014screen to screen, everyone down screen, here\u2019s a staggered screen,\u201d Houston said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it.

They are educated about three different types of meals they can eat depending on their workouts and goals for the day.\nThe meals follow the NBA acronym: an \u201cEnergy\u201d plate for double workout days requiring more carbohydrates, a \u201cBuild\u201d for a balanced meal, and an \u201cAdapt\u201d plate for recovery with additional protein.\nPlayers aren\u2019t on their own individual nutrition plans. They are provided with three different supplements: a multivitamin for macronutrients, a probiotic for gut health and Omega 3-6-9 for bone function.\n\u201cThe biggest thing for us honestly is the education,\u201d Stewart Mackie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always what they eat on campus, the three meals a day. We obviously know that they are eating other things too.\u201d\nBefore players leave for college, they take a cooking etiquette class to prepare them for life on their own, including learning how to shop and prepare meals on their own, according to Stewart-Mackie. Players are also educated on the right types of food to eat to maintain a healthy diet.\nSeventeen-year-old Zie Cheick Hassan Conde, a 6-foot-8 wing from the Ivory Coast, said the academy has taught him,\u201cdon\u2019t eat like pizza, hamburgers, not a lot because then that can have an impact on our performance.\u201d\nAcademy menus vary. Sometimes players are served dishes popular in the U.S, a way to introduce them to the kinds of food choices they will experience when participating in showcases tournaments for the academy.\nMostly, meals at the Academy reflect local Senegalese culture, like thieboudienne, a dish of jollof rice and fish. Jollof rice is a popular West African dish made with tomatoes, onions, peppers and a variety of herbs and spices. That\u2019s home-cooking for six of the 21 players at the academy from Senegal. Others must adapt.\nManuel Barreto Comboma, a 6-foot-7 wing from Angola, said the food was very different from what he had at home, highlighting the spices.\n\u201cThe food from Angola is way better, especially my mom\u2019s food,\u201d Comboma said.",

Through shared activities and team bonding, players like Zie Cheick Hassan Conde and Manuel Camboma overcome these obstacles, forming strong connections and improving their social and linguistic skills.",
    "content": "SALY, Senegal \u2014 It\u2019s tough being the new kid. But 17-year-old Zie Cheick Hassan Conde was just that when he arrived at NBA Academy Africa in September 2023. The 6-foot-8 wing was the only player from the Ivory Coast \u2014 he did not know anyone; he did not speak English; he worried about feeling alone.\nConde\u2019s story is common at the Academy, where high school-aged basketball talent is brought from all over the continent to develop, learn and bond. Players come from different upbringings,\u00a0 united only by their passion for the game of basketball, or so they think.\n\u201cI was alone. I was in my room. I didn\u2019t want to talk to everybody here,\u201d Conde said. \u201cWe play basketball together every day, so they push you to be social.\u201d\nTeam workouts and meals bring players together, but the shared moments during free time are just as important. The group visits the beach, enjoys shopping trips and long, emotionally fueled sessions of EA Sports FC.\nThis level of familiarity cannot be reached without first establishing a connection. As recruits at a basketball training program, the similarities are waiting to be discovered. But asking questions and learning about each other\u2019s lives is difficult with a language barrier.\n\u201cIt was very hard to communicate with my teammates, to make friends,\u201d said 18-year-old Angolan wing Manuel Camboma. \u201cI started learning English, and it became easier to talk to them.\u201d\nPlayers learn either English or French at the Academy, depending on what they already speak, according to Technical Director Roland Houston. A player like Camboma, who comes from a Portuguese-speaking country, studies both languages.\nA few players watch as Camboma stands up after speaking with Capital News Service on June 7. Camboma playfully shoves Conde away from his chair, and the other players assist in keeping Conde away from the camera. During practice later that day, Nigerian forward David Ugonna Ike heaves a ball at the rim to disrupt the midrange shooting routine of Tunisian guard Ahmed Bedoui. Bedoui expresses frustration, but Ike assures him he can\u2019t shoot anyway.\nThey argue; they compete; they laugh \u2014 like brothers.\nFor Senegalese players like wing Khadim Rassoul Mboup, the transition to NBA Africa is more immediately supported. More Academy players represent Senegal than any other country, increasing familiarity and comfort for someone who already does not have to cross a border.\n\u201cI was staying with the Senegalese people all the time, then they moved me in with a South Sudanese guy, and I started having conversations with him,\u201d Mboup said. \u201cAll the guys here are cool, but especially Khaman [Maluach] because he was my roommate for three years.\u201d\nKhaman Maluach, a 7-foot-1 center from South Sudan, is one of the Academy\u2019s most recent success stories, committed to play for Duke next season.\nNBA Academy Africa has recruited and trained elite youth basketball talent from around the continent since 2018. (Jenna Bloom/Capital News Service)\nBringing players together and creating circles of support are vital to putting them in a position to succeed once they leave NBA Africa, according to Houston. The coaches regularly hold game nights, movie nights, interactive community events, and other group activities to build a sense of camaraderie within the team.\nHouston recounted one time when the staff implemented assigned seating at meals to prevent players from the same country from always sitting together. Eventually, after coaches stopped seeing the same kids always hanging with each other and speaking native languages, the rule was no longer needed.\n\u201dIf you look at our group of guys, you\u2019ll say \u2018Wow, he\u2019s from Cameroon; he\u2019s from Senegal; he\u2019s from Nigeria,\u2019\u201d Houston said, pointing around the gym. \u201cYou could just look right there! You got Ivory Coast, Congo and Nigeria. That\u2019s beautiful. That\u2019s the brotherhood.\u201d\nWhere Mboup was once the incoming freshman, eager to find comfort around the older Senegalese players, he now recognizes his role as an Academy veteran, tasked with making sure new classes of players feel acclimated as soon as possible.\nMboup said he studies greetings and basic communications from the languages of incoming players to be able to talk with them and make them feel at home.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to transfer what the veterans gave me before they left,\u201d Mboup said. \u201cIt\u2019s the energy, encouraging the young guys and giving them the courage to play.\u201d",

    "content": "SALY, Senegal \u2014 Seifeldin Hendawy traveled to this coastal resort town when he was 16 years old. Over three thousand miles away from his home in Egypt, Hendawy chased a dream of a professional basketball career at NBA Academy Africa.\nHendawy arrived on the campus as one of the youngest players. The academy recruits prospects in Africa as young as 15. They often remain at the facility in Saly, about a two-hour drive from Dakar, until they embark on a college or professional basketball career. It\u2019s common for them to stay until they are 18 or 19.\nNow 18, Hendawy departed Senegal June 9 for Chicago. Next season, he\u2019ll play for Loyola Chicago at the Division I level. At the time he left here, he was one of the oldest players at the academy.\u00a0\nHendawy acclimated after he set foot in one of Africa\u2019s westernmost countries, but it took months. That\u2019s common for a youthful player at the academy. Coaches understand that the youngest players need special attention, said Roland Houston, technical director of NBA Academy Africa. But they strive for a balance. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not going to baby you, but we\u2019re going to put our arms around you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [a younger player] may be one of the better players here, but they still have so much to learn.\u201d\nOf the 22 rostered academy players, 15 are from countries other than Senegal. Some come from nations in Central and Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 like Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hendawy grew up in Egypt.\nRecruitment of players to the academy begins at an early age. Some of the most talented youth players move from SEED Academy in nearby Thies to the NBA Academy. SEED, a partner of the NBA, doesn\u2019t accept players under 14.\nJoel Ntale Kabugi from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the youngest player attending the academy now at 15 years old. Five other players are 16. The oldest prospect, Mouhamed Camara, is 19.\nEach player moves away from home, leaving family, culture and the way they live. For younger players, adapting to a new scene can be daunting from a social perspective. The academy staff attempts to ease the transition with team-bonding experiences, often on Sundays. Sometimes that means getting away from the academy campus and from basketball. The beach is just a ten-minute drive away. After that, the players might sink into the large over-stuffed couches in the academy\u2019s player\u2019s lounge to watch a movie.\nOn the court, the approach to supporting players, especially younger one, can vary. Coaches balance what they expect from the players with the circumstances they face when beginning at the academy. Players \u00a0normally adapt in three to six months, Houston said.\nSome graduates of the academy play at the highest level of college basketball for programs like Duke while others will play professionally \u00a0in Basketball Africa League or for a team in Europe. In most cases, it begins at a young age when they arrive in Senegal.\n\u201cI was a little bit scared \u2026 I come here and left West Africa,\u201d Hendawy said. \u201cMy character changed, my personality changed. The way I approach people and talk to them with confidence also changed. I\u2019m growing.\u201d",

These are the elite African professional basketball players that National Basketball Association fans have known over the decades, towering big men who dominate the low post on both ends of the floor.\nAs the sport grows in popularity on the continent, the beginnings of a new kind of top-level African talent is emerging.\n\u201cEverybody wants the 6-10, seven-footers, but we got 6-5 dudes,\u201d NBA Academy Africa Technical Director Roland Houston said, \u201cThis kid [Academy graduate, Amar Diop] going to Florida Atlantic can flat out play. We have guards. So that means we\u2019re here right now.\u201d\nNBA Academy Africa in this coastal town is one of \u00a0three overseas academies, along with locations in Mexico and Australia. The facility functions as a school and a rigorous training program for the most promising young players across Africa.\nWhile the Academy continues to house its share of giants, (nine of 21 current players are 6-10 or taller), it is also preparing a talented group of guards to succeed at basketball\u2019s highest levels.\nOne of those has been the team\u2019s point guard Seifeldin\u00a0\u201cSaif\u201d Hendawy, a recent Egyptian Academy graduate headed to Loyola-Chicago.\nHendawy never grew up trying to emulate any guards from his home continent, instead looking to American examples like Kyrie Irving and Magic Johnson.\nHis teammate and backcourt partner Ahmed Bedoui from Tunisia had one role model from his home country, Omar Abada who plays for the nine-time champions of the Egyptian Basketball Super League, Al Ahly, but when it comes to the NBA he has none. Instead, he said he looks up to American guards, his favorite being Austin Reaves.\nIn order to change that, young African players need access to top-level development work and the Academy is the place to find it.\n\u201cWhat we do on the ground as far as our drill work, our laboratory work, we hone in on those things that will translate [to the next level],\u201d Houston said.\nDuring an Academy practice the guards are separated from the bigs to work on ball handling, dribble drives to the basket, and scoring at the rim through contact from a defender. Later when they scrimmage, Hendawy gets to the basket and executes a crafty lay up while absorbing a blow from one of the team\u2019s giant centers.\nNBA Academy Africa is located in Saly, Senegal, about a two-hour drive from the capital of Dakar. (Matthew Neus/Capital News Service)\nAbsent from that practice with the flu was the Academy\u2019s youngest player, Joel Ntale Kabugi, a 6-3 guard from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who, according to his teammates, has given himself the nickname \u201cJoJo Batman\u201d.\nKabugi says the name was given to him by friends at home in the Congo.\nMany who watch Kabugi play sing his praises, specifically referencing his explosiveness. Kabugi\u2019s favorite player is Russell Westbrook and he thinks they share some traits on the court.\n\u201cThe explosivity, when he attacks the basket,\u201d Kabugi said.\nHe doesn\u2019t idolize any African guards, but his favorite player from his continent is Warriors\u2019 wing Jonathan Kuminga. The two players share the same Congolese hometown of Goma, but Kabugi hasn\u2019t had the chance to meet him yet.\nHe hopes to elevate his game enough that they may one day share a court.\nHenawy is trying to help him develop the same guard skills the Academy has gifted him.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of failure for you to succeed at the end,\u201d Hendawy said, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help him always have the feel of the game, do the right read, see the open man.\u201d\n\u201cSince I came to the academy, I\u2019ve been looking up to them [Hendawy and other older guards]. They\u2019ve been helping me a lot, everyday they give me advice,\u201d Kabugi said.\nHow good does Hendawy think \u201cJoJo Batman\u201d be?\n\u201cHe can be elite, really really he could be elite, better than Ant-Man [Anthony Edwards],\u201d he said.\nHendawy, Bedoui and Kabugi might not have had many NBA or Division 1 role models from their continent, but maybe one day they could be that for another kid.\n\u201cI will always try to mentor young generations when I grow up,\u201d Hendawy said, \u201cWhen I reach to a certain point, like my highest point that I could get. I\u2019m just going to always come back and give more and share my experiences.\u201d\nKabugi wants to return and help the local academy that helped him in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\u201cThey [Congolese kids at his academy] are not in a good situation, so they need someone who can provide something for them,\u201d Kabugi said. \u201cIf I make it to the NBA or somewhere pro, I\u2019ll be coming back.\u201d",

He flipped open a pizza box and diagrammed a coverage on the cardboard side.\n\u201cFirst, what I\u2019m going to do, is you\u2019re no help on the strong side. So for example, if he\u2019s driving to your side, and you have a shooter, you don\u2019t help,\u201d Camboma said.\nPlayers don\u2019t solely watch the stars. Kabugi admires Jrue Holiday\u2019s tenacity, calling him a \u201cgreat defender\u201d.

Academy technical director Roland Houston said that when the program started, it required a lot of work. He said that Senegalese players only interacted with each other before he was forced to break up their lunch table.\n\u201cWe have performance lifestyle classes. This is the [class that] teaches us how to become a leader,\u201d Hendawy said. \u201cAll of us are here to help each other.\u201d\nPlayers gather in the multipurpose room daily. They watch NBA highlights after morning practice, have game nights and play video games \u2013 until Maluach took his PlayStation to Duke. The chemistry in the room is evident, as they crack jokes and laugh easily.\u00a0\nThe topic of who\u2019s the best one-on-one player quickly arose. Hendawy claimed he beat everybody in the room. Camboma is quick to disagree.\n\u201cWhen you beat me, bro?\u201d Camboma said.\nTonight is a special occasion. The Academy usually practices in the early morning, meaning it\u2019s not feasible to watch live NBA games because of the time zone difference. But the staff granted a morning off Friday.\nThe Academy will likely feature its first first-round draft pick later this month. Maluach is projected to be a 2025 lottery pick. There\u2019s a business-like air that seeps through the various facilities. Players are self-motivated.\nEach individual\u2019s goal is different, but all have an overarching theme.

They have mentors in their corner.\n\u201cOkay, this is more than I, and I'm coming back to embrace and appreciate the beautiful moment,\u201d Chinyelu said. \u201cBeing able to have something like the NBA in the motherland, it's beautiful and I'm proud of that.\u201d\nNBA Africa CEO Clare Akamanzi said that the league has developed a ten-year plan.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re only in season four, so we will know that we will be profitable, and that\u2019s the journey that we\u2019re currently on,\u201d Akamanzi said.\n\nFormer players' involvement plays a large role. The NBA is still king in Africa. Young basketball players refer to players like Stephen Curry, James Harden and Kobe Bryant as their favorite basketball players. A global star from Africa could change everything.\nBut if the NBA continues to promote African players' journeys, it will increase the league\u2019s visibility across the continent.",

    "content": "KIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 On a pleasant June morning with the sun peeking behind the Rwandan clouds, two basketball courts tucked away from the bustling Kigali streets offer a brief respite.\nEnclosed by murals, trees and a chain-link fence, Club Rafiki courts are filled with more than 60 people on a Sunday morning. The four baskets serve as an impromptu age divider: young children play on the court with no nets; older players compete on the other side.\nKigali\u2019s Club Rafiki outdoor basketball court is uber-popular. Its easy accessibility is also an outlier in Africa. (Jenna Bloom/Capital News Service)\nThis year marks the club\u2019s 50th anniversary. It has survived a genocide and a pandemic. The outdoor basketball court was established in 2022 by Giants of Africa, a nonprofit organization aiming to build 100 accessible basketball courts in Africa. Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri co-founded the organization and was in Rwanda during the Basketball Africa League (BAL) championship weekend.\nIt\u2019s free to use and is in a central part of Rwanda\u2019s capital. The court rarely empties.\n\u201cAt home, I\u2019m shy. When I play basketball here, I feel good,\u201d Chris Sherma, a 13-year-old local basketball player, said.\nBut Club Rafiki is an outlier. The popularity of basketball has skyrocketed in Africa and Rwanda, throughout the past decade. The BAL final in Rwanda brought the focus of the international basketball world onto the growth of the game in Africa. But accessibility to the sport still lags behind its growing interest.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the challenges we\u2019ve been trying to tackle,\u201d Zephanie Niyonkuru, permanent secretary of the Rwanda Ministry of Sports, said. \u201cMaking sure that we build courts, working with the local government. So infrastructure is the number one [challenge].\u201d\u00a0\nChris Sherma, 13, wants to be an NBA star. He feels at home at Club Rafiki\u2019s outdoor courts in Kigali. (Jenna Bloom/Capital News Service)\nBasketball courts were sparse in Africa a decade ago. A 2022 Taiyuan University of Technology study revealed that 39% of Rwandan respondents were dissatisfied with the current basketball infrastructure in secondary schools.\n\u201cIn Africa, it\u2019s almost impossible to find a good indoor basketball court,\u201d Chris Ramsay, a member of Africa Outreach USA, said.\nMultiple sources, including former NBA players Ian Mahinmi and Festus Ezeli, also said infrastructure was the biggest barrier the sport faced in Africa.\nThe Taiyuan University researchers acknowledged the survey\u2019s respondents likely live in urban areas, due to the challenges of surveying rural homes in Rwanda. Courts are even sparser in rural areas. The lack of structures makes it even more challenging for Rwandans outside of the nation\u2019s capital, Kigali, to compete in basketball.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not many places like [Club Rafiki] in rural places,\u201d local basketball player Shami Maridadi said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for them. \u2026 Those in rural places, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much.\u201d\nNiyonkuru said there are sectors, which are divisions of Rwanda\u2019s 30 districts, without a basketball court. There is a \u201cmassive\u201d concentration of courts in urban areas, he said.\nTo combat that, the department provided funding to local governments across the country in order to build courts in rural areas. Niyonkuru said the Rwanda government would need to have 2,000 additional courts across the country to fit the need. He called it a crazy number.\nBut interest in basketball is booming.\nAt the Club Rafiki Courts, popular basketball shoe models such as Nike\u2019s Lebron James and Kobe Bryant, Under Armour\u2019s Stephen Curry and Adidas James Harden line the feet of children.\u00a0\nDaniel, an 18-year-old boy, said his family saved money to buy basketball shoes. He said he plays basketball three times a week at Club Rafiki.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a safe place for people to come,\u201d he said.\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way.\u00a0\nLongtime Club Rafiki visitor, Bizab Bizimana, 44, said a lot of fights broke out at Club Rafiki\u2019s indoor courts in the 1980s. He said oftentimes, there would be two basketballs to share amongst more than 100 people. The court wasn\u2019t a place to play basketball, rather a social area.\n\u201cNow, you can tell that everyone who is here wants to play basketball,\u201d Bizimana said.\nThere has never been an NBA player from Rwanda. The government is aware of that and is attempting to increase courts and grassroots. It will take time, though.\nToronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri is aiming to build over 100 courts across Africa. His foundation, Giants of Africa, established the court in Kigali (Jenna Bloom/Capital News Service).\n\u201cThe basketball infrastructure is on the rise for sure, but it\u2019s not close to where soccer would be. Or where it might be in Eastern Europe or even South America,\u201d Ramsay said.\nIt\u2019s the crowning message of Club Rafiki. At the back of the court, stretched across the fence for all players to see, a blue banner hangs. It reads: Club Rafiki Dreams Big.",

    "content": "KIGALI, Rwanda \u2013Nick Faust was a high school basketball star in Baltimore 13 years ago.\u00a0\nOn Saturday, he scored a team-leading 24 points in a championship game over 7,000 miles from his hometown Baltimore neighborhood. Faust led the pro team from Angola to a 107-94 win in the Basketball Africa League title contest.\nFaust said that his upbringing in Baltimore prepared him for the winding path that his basketball career has taken.\n\u201cBeing in Baltimore, you just got to be a tough kid. I\u2019m not going to lie and say it\u2019s all ice cream and sprinkles,\u201d Faust said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to decide, do you want to be in the streets? Or are you going to decide you want to be something in life.\u201d\nA top-50 high school player in the country and the top prospect in Maryland according to 247 Sports, Faust committed to former coach Gary Williams and the University of Maryland.\nAfter a strong freshman season, Faust\u2019s collegiate career fizzled. The NBA never called, and Faust became a basketball nomad, playing professionally in eight countries.\nHe might have finally found a stable home. Faust is starring in the BAL for Angola\u2019s team, Petro de Luanda. He\u2019s averaging 16 points per game, on 42.3% shooting from three.\nFaust shot 9-15 from the field and made four three pointers on Sunday. Petro de Luanda secured its first BAL championship over the reigning winner\u00a0Al Ahly Ly. It was also Faust\u2019s first professional title of his career.\nNick Faust shined in the BAL this season. Courtesy of BAL/Getty Images.\nThat would have been unthinkable to him as an 18-year-old. He was a high school star at Baltimore City College, leading the Black Knights to consecutive Maryland Class 2A state titles in 2009 and 2010. He\u2019s no longer the teenager whose only dream was making it to the NBA.\n\u201cBeing in high school, if some guy said to me [I\u2019d be playing in Africa], I\u2019d laugh at him,\u201d Faust said.\nFaust emerged on the national scene after his junior year of high school. After Williams retired and Mark Turgeon became Maryland\u2019s head coach, Faust said he received calls from former Kentucky coach John Calipari and former UConn coach Kevin Ollie. He remained committed to the Terps, though.\nThat looked like a wise choice after his first season. Faust averaged 8.9 points per game and was selected for the All-ACC freshman team.\nNicholas Faust\u2019s career never took off after his time in College Park. He\u2019s shining in the Basketball Africa League (Photo courtesy of Maryland athletics).\nHis career in College Park never reached expectations, though. Faust transferred to Long Beach State for his final season, before going undrafted. It\u2019s something he still thinks about today.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t have someone in my back corner telling me what the path of what we could do,\u201d said Faust, whose college career played out before Name Image and Likeness and other commercial opportunities for college and international pro players.\nFaust signed his first professional deal with an Israeli team, Ironi Nahariya, for the 2016\u201317 season.\nThat started him on a winding professional career. Faust has signed nine different contracts to play basketball in countries including Taiwan, Italy and Poland.\nHis stops never lasted longer than three years. Faust said he lives out of a suitcase. The veteran has grown accustomed to the consistent upheaval.\u00a0\n\u201cAll I can say is I\u2019m on my third passport,\u201d Faust joked.\n\nFor a majority of his career, none of those options included Africa. The continent had limited professional basketball options until the BAL was founded in 2019.\nThe league was established by the National Basketball Association and the International Basketball Federation. Investors and strategic partners include former president Barack Obama and former Chicago Bulls stars Luol Deng and Joakim Noah propelled the league.\u00a0\nToday the league's games are broadcast in over 200 countries, BAL aims to become the premier international basketball league.\n\u201cI never thought that something like the [BAL] could be possible,\u201d Ian Mahimi, a former Washington Wizards player and BAL ambassador, said.\nFaust didn\u2019t either. The Baltimore native imagined Africa as a place he would visit as a tourist, envisioning lions and zebras on safaris, not a realistic career option.\nBut after he and his previous team, Indonesia\u2019s Amartha Hangtuah, agreed to part ways, Faust was searching for options. His agent told him that Petro de Luanda was looking for talent for their playoff run.\nFaust secured his first professional basketball title on Saturday. Courtesy of BAL/Getty Images\nWhen he called his father to tell him that he had signed a contract with a team in Angola, the reaction was expected.\n\u201cDad, I'm in Africa,\u201d Faust told his dad.\n\u201cMan, you\u2019re out there with lions?\u201d his father responded.\nFaust has been with the Angola team for just over two weeks. In his brief time, he has been impressed by the league\u2019s structure and stability, despite being in its early stages.\n\u201cThe NBA has a 75-year plan,\u201d said Pops Mensah-Bonsu, a former NBA player whose parents are from Ghana and who is President of G-League Operations for the New York Knicks. \u201cThe [BAL] has to crawl before we can walk. We have to develop something and implement a foundation.\u201d\n\u201cThis might be the best league I\u2019ve ever played in,\u201d Faust said.\n\n(00:12) Basketball Africa League Player, Nick Faust, talks about his mindset when building his professional basketball career.\nFaust\u2019s career did not pan out the way he envisioned it.

    "content": "Jackson Holliday\u2019s demotion to the minor leagues on April 26 came amid his historically futile start at the plate in the majors.\nDrafted first overall by the Baltimore Orioles in 2022, Holliday coasted through the organization\u2019s lower levels and was summoned this year on April 10 to the big league club for the first time.\nBut the hype that engulfed Holliday\u2019s major league debut gradually dissipated amid the prized prospect\u2019s treacherous first stint at the top level.\nHolliday collected just two hits over his first 34 major league at-bats \u2014 the fewest hits by a No. 1 overall pick in that window \u2014 before being sent down to Triple-A Norfolk.\nThe 20-year-old\u2019s struggles were surprising considering how well he mashed minor league pitching. \nHolliday batted .321 in 155 minor league games before hitting just .059 during his 10-game stint with Baltimore. No position player drafted first overall had a larger negative difference in their career minor league batting average and their average across their first 34 major league at-bats.\n\u201cHe got very intense, very specific feedback from major league pitching,\u201d Orioles general manager Mike Elias told reporters on April 26.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant talent and a very sharp kid, and I expect he\u2019s going to go and implement those adjustments really quickly,\u201d Elias said, \u201cbut we felt that steady playing time in Triple-A was the place for that.\u201d\n\nHolliday\u2019s rough stint with Baltimore came after he made a strong case to immediately begin the 2024 season in the major leagues. \nHe hit .311 with two home runs for the big league club this year during Spring Training but was sent to the minor leagues for about the first two weeks of the season. Elias said the left-handed hitter needed to gain more experience against left-handed pitchers.\nHindsight suggests the former No. 1 pick may have needed even more time in the minor leagues before being promoted to the majors. However, history says Holliday\u2019s struggles had little to do with his minor league experience.\nCapital News Service found minimal correlation between the number of at-bats a top pick had in the minor leagues before playing in an MLB game and the number of hits they had over their first 34 big league at-bats. \nHolliday registered 583 minor-league at-bats before his MLB debut, the 11th-fewest among the 37 position players ever selected first overall. \n\u201cWe moved him very fast in the minors, but it\u2019s because he was doing so well,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWe were trying to get him to a spot where he (was) challenged.\u201d\nEvery top pick besides Holliday had at least four hits over their first 34 MLB at-bats, but more minor league at-bats didn\u2019t promise immediate success in the majors.\nDave Roberts went straight to the major leagues after being drafted first overall by the San Diego Padres in 1972 and collected eight hits in his first 34 at-bats. Meanwhile, Phil Nevin had half as many hits as Roberts despite logging over 1,100 minor league at-bats before making his MLB debut for the Houston Astros in 1995.\n\nHolliday simply looked overmatched at times against major league pitching. \nHalf of his swings resulted in misses, a rate double the major league average. Holliday struck out in exactly half of his 36 plate appearances for Baltimore, well above the league rate (22 percent) and his rate in the minor leagues (19 percent) prior to his MLB debut.\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re struggling a little bit, you just start searching,\u201d Holliday said in an article published on April 23 by The Athletic.\n\u201c \u2026 It\u2019s a lot more difficult than Triple-A. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s very many people in the big leagues who haven\u2019t struggled. It just happens to be at the beginning.\u201d\nHolliday faltered for the Orioles especially when chasing pitches, or swinging at offerings outside of the strike zone. His chase rate mirrored that of the typical MLB hitter, but his 27.2% contact rate on chase swings was well below the league average of 57.9%.\nHe was also more passive at the plate than the typical MLB batter. Holliday swung 7.8% less frequently than the average hitter, including 11.7% less often on pitches inside the strike zone.\n\n\u201cThis game up here, people attack your weaknesses until you stop showing them to be weaknesses,\u201d Elias said. \u201cAnd he kind of knows what that attack looks like right now, and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to concentrate his work on some of those areas.\u201d\nThe timetable for Holliday\u2019s return to the major leagues is uncertain, though some within the Orioles organization believe he will not be down in the minor leagues for very long.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s one of the most mature people I\u2019ve met,\u201d Baltimore infielder Jordan Westburg said, per MASN Sports. \u201c \u2026 It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this is just a short stint to get some confidence back, get some (at-bats) and come back up here and really help this club.\u201d\nElias praised Holliday\u2019s \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d and said he doubts that the Orioles\u2019 top prospect is dwelling on his underwhelming big league debut. The general manager is confident that getting Holliday extra repetitions in the minor leagues will pay off when the acclaimed infielder returns to the big stage.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be putting work in,\u201d Elias said, \u201cbut he also will be ready for whenever his name is called.\u201d",

    "summary": "The 2024 NFL Draft saw six quarterbacks selected within the top 12 picks, highlighting the critical importance of finding a franchise quarterback, though the success of these prospects remains highly uncertain and dependent on both their talent and team support. Teams like Chicago, Washington, New England, Atlanta, Minnesota, and Denver are banking on these young quarterbacks to provide a significant competitive advantage during their rookie contracts, given the quarterback's pivotal role in the offense-driven NFL.",
    "content": "The 2024 NFL Draft, like most of its predecessors, was defined by its quarterbacks. Six of the top 12 selections were quarterbacks, including the top three picks. \nThe selections will define the future of their franchises. Each team believes \u2014 or at least hopes \u2014 their selection will be an above-average or better starting quarterback. \nBut finding that quarterback is extremely difficult. As The Washington Post wrote: \u201cno one knows for sure which prospect will bust and which will go to the Hall of Fame. Many analysts call the process a \u2018crapshoot.\u2019\u201d\nWhether quarterbacks succeed or not depends on their innate talent and work ethic, but also their teams\u2019 situations. Modern quarterback analysis no longer limits itself to seeing if players fail \u2014 it also examines if they were failed by the infrastructure around them.\n\u201cI think most guys exist somewhere in the middle where they need a little bit of help,\u201d said Robert Mays, the host of The Athletic Football Show. \u201cThere are players, that if they hadn\u2019t gotten an influx of talent at some point during that rookie contract, who knows what would have happened.\u201d\nThe Chicago Bears took Caleb Williams at No. 1 overall. The Washington Commanders took Jayden Daniels at No. 2. The New England Patriots took Drake Maye at No. 3. The Atlanta Falcons took Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8. The Minnesota Vikings took J.J. McCarthy at No. 10. The Denver Broncos took Bo Nix at No. 12.\nMost of them will likely play early in their careers. The lone exception is Atlanta, who picked Michael Penix but signed Kirk Cousins to a lucrative contract in March.\n\nThose five teams have wildly different supporting casts but each wants to land the biggest advantage in football: a talented starting quarterback on a rookie contract. \nWhy is that so important? The realities and economics of the sport explain. The quarterback is the most important player on the team. He touches the ball on almost every single offensive play in a league that emphasizes offense and passing. In accordance with that value, the top 15 average annual salaries in the NFL are all quarterbacks. \nThose contracts occupy a large part of the NFL\u2019s salary cap, a strict limit on how much teams can spend on players. But rookie salaries \u2014 which cover the first four to five years of a player\u2019s career \u2014 are artificially deflated based on drafting order.\nJoe Burrow and C.J Stroud \u2014 two similarly talented players \u2014 exemplify this dynamic and how it affects their teams salary cap situations. Burrow, who was drafted in 2020, signed a contract extension in 2023. From 2024-26, he will have an average annual salary of slightly over $41 million according to Spotrac. \nStroud, who was drafted in 2023 and is still on his rookie contract, will average under $9 million per year in that span. \n\nMaximizing that financial flexibility means maximizing the quarterback. That comes by surrounding them with the right offensive support. The three main categories of offensive support are the offensive playcaller, offensive line and pass catchers. \nTo Mays, the playcaller is most important.\n\u201cYou can control the structure of the offense,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tailor it to your quarterback strengths. You can make sure that you\u2019re consistently putting him in positions to succeed.\u201d\nKevin O\u2019Connell and Sean Payton, the head coaches for the Vikings and Broncos respectively, could give their young quarterbacks an early advantage because of their playcalling expertise. \nO\u2019Connell learned under two of the NFL\u2019s best in Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay while Payton, formerly the head coach in New Orleans, made the Saints consistently one of the league\u2019s best offenses.\nExamining the offensive line, Mays said he valued a \u201csolid\u201d offensive line. He placed more importance on not having weak links along the five-man unit. \nThat\u2019s not the case for pass catchers \u2014 wide receivers and tight ends.\n\u201cYou need top level receivers for a young quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 You need someone [where] the passing game goes through them. They are the number one option.\u201d\nHe highlighted a litany of examples: Burrow and Jamarr Chase, Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs and more. \n\u201cIf you have that streamlined option, it is such a huge help as you\u2019re a young quarterback trying to learn how to see the game, how to feel the game,\u201d Mays said. \nOf the five teams who will likely have their rookies play this year, only two had multiple players who averaged over 50 receiving yards per game last season: Chicago and Minnesota. The Bears already had DJ Moore but added Keenan Allen via trade and receiver Rome Odunze, the No. 9 pick in the NFL draft, to bolster their attack.\n\nThe Vikings return Justin Jefferson, who Mays called the best receiver in the league, and Jordan Addison, who was third among rookie receivers last year in yards. \nWashington\u2019s Terry McLaurin may not have the stats of Jefferson or Moore, but Mays believes that\u2019s more a product of his dismal situations.\n\u201cI think you can build your passing game through Terry McLaurin \u2026 we\u2019ve never seen him with half decent quarterback play,\u201d Mays said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys to me where if you get him with the right quarterback, I think you could see what he\u2019s really capable of.\u201d\nWilliams, Daniels, Maye, McCarthy and Nix all have control over how their professional careers unfold. But they are not the sole arbiters of their fates. That responsibility also falls to the teams that drafted them, ones who are now tasked with building up these young players and turning them into the kinds of players who justify their early selections in the draft.",

    "content": "April 25 marks the beginning of the NFL Draft, a three-day event during which the league\u2019s 32 teams select the top collegiate players.\nWhile none of this year\u2019s most coveted prospects played college football in Maryland, the state may produce a few selections in the later rounds.\nFormer Maryland Terrapins safety Beau Brade is the highest-rated prospect this year by NFL.com among those who played college football in Maryland. A few other former Terrapins, including quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa, are also potential picks.\nOther Maryland colleges like Towson, Morgan State and Navy currently don\u2019t have any prospects listed on NFL.com, but each school has produced multiple NFL Draft picks over the years.\nWith the 89th NFL Draft two days away, here is what to know about every player selected from a Maryland college:\nMost draft picks from Maryland colleges are former Terrapins\nThere have been 319 players from a Maryland college selected in the NFL Draft since the annual event began in 1936.\nSeventy percent of those drafted players have attended the University of Maryland, College Park. Most of the rest have been selected from either Morgan State, the Naval Academy or Maryland Eastern Shore, which discontinued its football program in 1980.\nSix players have been drafted from Towson, while Frostburg State and Johns Hopkins have each produced one selection.\n\nThe number of rounds and overall picks in the NFL Draft has changed throughout the past eight-plus decades. Today\u2019s draft structure has seven rounds, each with 32 picks, for a total of 224 selections.\nForty-three players from Maryland colleges have been selected somewhere between No. 65 and No. 96 overall, making them third-round picks under the draft\u2019s current format. Meanwhile, the 91 players picked later than No. 224 overall would not have been selected in today\u2019s draft.\nRandy White is the state\u2019s highest draft pick \u2014 the Dallas Cowboys selected the former Maryland Terrapins standout second overall in 1975. Joe Cowan, Johns Hopkins\u2019 lone selection, was the 441st player chosen in the 1969 draft, making him Maryland\u2019s lowest overall pick.\n\nMaryland college draft picks play in an average of 66 NFL games\nTwo-thirds of the 319 players drafted from a Maryland college have appeared in an NFL game. The 215 players with at least one NFL appearance have played in an average of 66 games over their respective careers as of April 2024.\nSeventeen Maryland college draft picks are currently on an NFL roster, and all but two attended the University of Maryland.\nStefon Diggs is perhaps the most notable active player drafted from a Maryland college.\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected the wide receiver from the University of Maryland with the 146th pick in 2015. Diggs has amassed 9,995 receiving yards and 67 touchdown receptions entering his 10th season.\nThe former Terrapin is best known for his game-winning, 61-yard touchdown reception as time expired in the Vikings\u2019 29-24 win over the New Orleans Saints in the 2017 NFC Divisional Playoffs.\nDiggs, along with fellow University of Maryland draftees Yannick Ngakoue and Quinton Jefferson, are among the four active NFL players with at least 100 career NFL appearances.\nJoe Cardona is the longest-tenured active NFL player drafted from a Maryland college. The New England Patriots long snapper has played in 144 games since the team drafted him from Navy in 2015.\nCardona would need to play about five more full seasons to eclipse Carl Hairston for the most career appearances by a player selected from a Maryland college. Hairston played in 224 games throughout his 15-year career, which began when the Philadelphia Eagles selected the defensive lineman from Maryland-Eastern Shore in 1976.\n\nMaryland colleges have produced seven Hall of Fame draft picks\nRoughly one in 45 NFL Draft picks from a Maryland college has forged a Hall of Fame career.\nWhite, enshrined in 1994, and Stan Jones, a 1991 inductee, are the Terrapins\u2019 two Hall of Fame draft picks. White\u2019s Dallas Cowboys teammate, quarterback Roger Staubach, is Navy\u2019s lone Hall of Famer. Art Shell remains the only Hall of Fame draft pick from Maryland-Eastern Shore.\nThe state\u2019s three remaining Hall of Famers played collegiately at Morgan State, which has produced just 36 of the state\u2019s 319 draft picks.\nRoosevelt Brown, selected in 1953 out of Morgan State, was the first draft pick from a Maryland college to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Following Brown\u2019s induction in 1975, Willie Lanier and Leroy Kelly joined their fellow Morgan State star in the Hall of Fame in 1986 and 1994, respectively.\n\nBrown played in 162 games and earned six All-Pro awards over 13 seasons, but the legendary left tackle may not have been selected if the current NFL Draft structure existed in the 1950s. Brown was picked 322nd overall, a slot well beyond today\u2019s draft format.\nMeanwhile, White\u2019s Hall of Fame career fulfilled his worth as the highest draft pick out of a Maryland college. White is one of the state\u2019s nine collegiate players \u2014 all of whom are former Terrapins \u2014 to be drafted in the top 10.",

Despite having one of the largest arenas in the Big Ten, Xfinity Center struggled to fill its nearly 18,000 seats, affecting the overall game atmosphere.",
    "content": "Empty seats were a familiar sight at Maryland men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball games this past season. Both teams struggled, particularly the men\u2019s team, which notched a losing record for just the second time since 1993. Both squads regularly played in front of sparse crowds.\nThe Asbury Park Press, a New Jersey-based outlet, covered the men\u2019s team\u2019s game against Rutgers and noted \u201cfewer than 8,000 fans showed up for this game and mostly sat there mostly muted \u2026 .a surprisingly anemic turnout.\u201d\nThe Terps had only one sellout each this season: against Purdue for the men, and against Iowa for the women. These games brought high-profile players to College Park \u2014 both opponents finished in second place in the national championship. \nAt a glance, other stadiums may look more crowded. But Xfinity Center has more seats to sell than many other college teams. With a capacity of just under 18,000, the Terps have the 14th largest venue in the nation, per an email from Jason Yellin, Maryland\u2019s Strategic Communications Officer and Associate Athletic Director.\n\u201cMaryland has one of the top atmospheres in all of college basketball,\u201d Yellin wrote in the email. \u201cWe do need to sell significantly more tickets than most others across the country to completely fill the building, but when it is at capacity, XFINITY Center provides an unmatched homecourt advantage, one that Maryland takes great pride in.\u201d\nMaryland has the second largest arena in the Big Ten for both sports. Only the Schottenstein Center at Ohio State has more seats. \n\nMaryland\u2019s men\u2019s team ranked 21st in total attendance nationally and 22nd for average attendance per game. \n\nMaryland\u2019s women\u2019s team ranked 11th in total attendance and ninth in average attendance.\nFor most of the Big Ten, the number of seats in a school\u2019s athletics center is roughly proportional to the total number of students enrolled. \nMaryland has the fourth smallest number of undergraduate students in the conference, but its population at roughly 30,000 is closer to the larger schools than the smaller ones. \nThe exception to the general trend is Rutgers \u2014 despite boasting roughly 36,000 students as of fall 2022, numbers similar to Indiana, Illinois, Purdue, and Wisconsin, the Rutgers Athletic Center holds only 8,000 fans.\nOnly Northwestern has fewer seats at just over 7,000. But as the conference\u2019s sole private school, the Wildcats have a much smaller student population of roughly 9,000, just a fraction of the size of other Big Ten Schools \u2014 Nebraska is next smallest with roughly 19,000 students. \n\nThe next smallest arena in the Big Ten is Michigan. The Wolverines, despite their athletic prowess in football, have only 12,707 seats for basketball fans at the Crisler Center.\n\nAround the country, a few colleges have started to move to smaller arenas. When four-time basketball champion Baylor moved from its longtime home, the Ferrell Center, to its new arena, the Foster Pavilion, it reduced capacity from just over 10,000 to 7,500. \nTexas used to have a capacity of 17,900 \u2014 roughly the same as Maryland. Its new home, the Moody Center, fits closer to 11,000.\nAdvantages to smaller arenas also include reducing the distance between the seats and the action.\nMaryland does get a massive advantage when Xfinity Center is packed \u2014 there are few better atmospheres in college basketball \u2014 but those situations rarely occur. Maryland currently doesn\u2019t plan to replace the arena, according to Yellin, although they do plan to have a \u201cpremier hospitality club\u201d and a \u201cstate-of-the-art videoboard and high-tech sound system\u201d ready ahead of next season.\n\u201cWe are continually evaluating ways in which we can enhance the venue and the overall fan experience,\u201d Yellin said in the email.",

    "content": "Opening Day in Baltimore is a festive occasion.\nThousands of fans clad in orange and black parade down Eutaw Street and cram into Camden Yards to welcome their beloved Orioles back to the field for another season.\nThis year\u2019s home opener on Thursday \u2014 weather permitting \u2014 against the Los Angeles Angels brings even more reasons for excitement.\nBaltimore begins its 2024 campaign as a legitimate World Series contender after piling up 101 wins a season ago en route to the franchise\u2019s first division title since 2014.\nFans will also get to cheer on starting pitcher Corbin Burnes, who will make his Orioles debut after the team traded for the former Cy Young winner in February.\nRain in Thursday\u2019s forecast threatens either a soggy opener, or one that\u2019s postponed to Friday.\nBut Baltimore fans \u2014 especially those who were at Camden Yards on Opening Day in 2003 \u2014 know how quickly the weather can change.\nAnd if the Orioles\u2019 recent home openers are any indication, Camden Yards will be characteristically packed this year on Opening Day, regardless of the weather.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a look into the history of attendance and first-pitch temperatures on Opening Day in Baltimore:\n Crowded Camden \nOpening Day in 1992 was particularly special in Baltimore.\nAside from the commencement of a new season, fans on April 6 celebrated a new era of Orioles baseball, one marked by the team\u2019s first game at Camden Yards.\nBaltimore blanked Cleveland 2-0 that day in front of a sellout crowd of 44,568 fans, and the image of a packed Camden Yards on Opening Day has been a routine sight ever since.\nBut Opening Day sellouts weren\u2019t always the norm in Baltimore.\nAttendance varied considerably for the Orioles\u2019 home openers at Memorial Stadium, where the team spent its first 38 seasons after moving to Baltimore in 1954.\nOver 46,000 fans filled Memorial Stadium on April 15, 1954, to greet the Orioles for their first home game upon returning to Baltimore after the city endured a 52-year lull without a Major League club.\nBaltimore\u2019s triumphant Opening Day turnout in 1954 proved to be an anomaly for the next two-plus decades. The Orioles wouldn\u2019t draw over 40,000 fans for a home opener again until 1976 despite winning two World Series during that span.\n\nJust 11,379 fans filed into Memorial Stadium for the 1962 home opener, which remains Baltimore\u2019s lowest-attended Opening Day without capacity restrictions since the Orioles returned to the city.\nAttendance surged beginning in 1980, when the Orioles trotted onto the Memorial Stadium grass in front of a then-Opening Day record crowd of 50,199. At least 50,000 fans attended each of Baltimore\u2019s next 10 home openers, including the final one at Memorial Stadium in 1991.\nStrong Opening Day attendance has carried over to the Orioles\u2019 current ballpark.\nCamden Yards has seated over 44,000 fans for almost every home opener since the stadium opened. The only exceptions were in 2020 and 2021, when COVID restrictions limited in-person attendance.\n Wild Weather \nOne of Baltimore\u2019s most iconic Opening Days was in 2003, when a sudden surge of snow delayed the Orioles\u2019 March 31 game against Cleveland in the third inning.\n\u201cThe first two innings, they were beautiful,\u201d said Rodrigo L\u00f3pez, Baltimore\u2019s starting pitcher that day, in a YouTube video released by the Orioles in 2020. \u201c \u2026 It was sunny, not too cold \u2014 good conditions to play baseball.\u201d\nIn the top of the third inning, overcast clouds converged on the ballpark, giving way to flurries that quickly intensified as Camden Yards resembled a snow globe amid the blizzard-like conditions.\n\u201cIt was hard for me to see the signs from [catcher Ger\u00f3nimo Gil],\u201d L\u00f3pez said.\nSeeing the ball wasn\u2019t much easier.\nWith one out in the top of the third inning, Cleveland\u2019s Ellis Burks lofted a fly ball that disappeared into the snow until Orioles right fielder Jay Gibbons found the ball lying in front of the warning track.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even see it at the plate,\u201d Burks told reporters after the game. \u201cI told the umpire I couldn\u2019t see it. I asked him if he could see it and he said, \u2018A little.\u2019\u201d\nMeanwhile, Gibbons said he couldn\u2019t even see Burks, adding that he only heard the ball hit the bat.\n\u201cI saw the umpire looking at me; I think he was waiting for me to make a move,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201c \u2026 I had no chance. I think it might have gone in the stands and come out. Nobody knows. It was a really strange play.\u201d\nL\u00f3pez recalled the ball landing foul, but Burks was ultimately credited with an RBI single.\n\u201cThat was total confusion,\u201d L\u00f3pez said.\nUmpires delayed the game shortly thereafter until the storm dissipated.\nThe Orioles prevailed 6-5 in 13 innings, an appropriate reward for the fans who braved what had been the chilliest Opening Day in Baltimore, with a first-pitch temperature of 42 degrees.\n2004\u2019s home opener, a rare night game to begin the Orioles\u2019 home slate, was even more brisk. The temperature at first pitch measured 40 degrees, which remains the coldest Opening Day start in Baltimore to date.\n\nOther home openers in Baltimore have called for sunscreen and shorts instead of snow hats and scarves.\nThe final Opening Day at Memorial Stadium in 1991 still stands as the city\u2019s hottest home opener, with a first-pitch temperature of 89 degrees. Fans seven years later were treated to an unseasonably warm 85-degree day at Camden Yards, Baltimore\u2019s third-warmest Opening Day.\nNo fans were present for the hottest home opener in Camden Yards history, an 88-degree night in July during the pandemic-affected 2020 campaign.\nAs of 2023, the average first-pitch temperature on Opening Day in Baltimore is 60 degrees. This season\u2019s opener should hover around that mark no matter what day the game is played. Thursday\u2019s projected high temperature is 57 degrees, while Friday\u2019s forecast calls for a high of 63.",

This trend has persisted throughout John Harbaugh's tenure as head coach, with the team committing 98% more turnovers per game in the fourth quarter during the playoffs compared to the regular season.",
    "content": "Lamar Jackson stood at the podium on Jan. 28 after he and the Baltimore Ravens suffered a season-ending 17-10 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game.\nA reporter asked the quarterback what traits he wanted his Ravens to emulate from a Kansas City team that had just won its fourth conference championship amid a string of six-straight appearances.\u00a0\n\u201cNo turnovers,\u201d Jackson said.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 (Kansas City) played the game basically perfect. They put points on the board. I felt like if we wouldn\u2019t have turned the ball over \u2026 we definitely woulda came out with a win.\u201d\nBaltimore committed three turnovers in the loss, including a pair of deflating giveaways in the fourth quarter that stalled its push to trim a 17-7 deficit.\nThe Ravens\u2019 two fourth-quarter turnovers played a role in denying the franchise its first Super Bowl appearance in 11 years and prolonged a troubling trend that has persisted since current head coach John Harbaugh took over in 2008.\nIn each of its 11 playoff seasons under Harbaugh, Baltimore has averaged more fourth-quarter turnovers in its postseason games than it did in its regular season games.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder if the Ravens\u2019 high fourth-quarter turnover rate during the playoffs simply stems from facing better defenses.\u00a0\nAccounting for an entire game \u2014 not just the fourth quarter \u2014 throughout its 11 playoff seasons with Harbaugh as head coach, Baltimore commits 0.7 more turnovers per game in the postseason than it does in the regular season.\u00a0\nBut examining the Ravens\u2019 per-game turnovers on a more granular level reveals that the team is especially inept in the fourth quarter during playoff games.\u00a0\nBaltimore\u2019s per-game turnover rate during the fourth quarter is 98% higher in the postseason than in the regular season.\u00a0Comparatively, the Ravens\u2019 per-game giveaways throughout the first three quarters increase by 14% from the regular season to the playoffs.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s late-game ball security has correlated heavily with the team\u2019s postseason fate under Harbaugh. Nineteen of the Ravens\u2019 23 fourth-quarter playoff giveaways since 2008 have occurred in losses.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that fourth-quarter turnovers are the sole reason for Baltimore\u2019s playoff defeats, but some miscues have been more consequential than others.\nNone was more devastating than backup quarterback Tyler Huntley\u2019s fumble against Cincinnati in the 2022 AFC Wild Card Game.\nLess than 12 minutes remained in a 17-17 game when the Ravens faced third-and-goal from the 1-yard-line. Huntley fumbled as he tried to extend the football over the goal line on a leaping quarterback sneak. Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard snagged the loose ball and raced 98 yards for what proved to be the deciding touchdown in the Ravens\u2019 24-17 loss.\n\n\u201cWe felt we had a good call,\u201d said Harbaugh of the decision to keep the ball in Huntley\u2019s hands instead of calling for a handoff. \u201c \u2026 It wasn\u2019t executed the correct way. Tyler went over the top. It\u2019s a burrow play, he\u2019s gotta go low on that.\u201d\nHuntley\u2019s fumble was the costliest of Baltimore\u2019s 23 fourth-quarter playoff turnovers in terms of win probability added, a statistic that measures how much an individual play impacts a team\u2019s chance of winning the game.\u00a0\nHubbard\u2019s go-ahead touchdown shriveled the Ravens\u2019 WPA against Cincinnati from 65.7% to 17.1%. Excluding Huntley\u2019s miscue, six of Baltimore\u2019s fourth-quarter postseason turnovers have carried at least a 10% decrease in the Ravens' WPA.\nPart of Baltimore\u2019s elevated turnover rate in the fourth quarter of playoff games expectedly stems from failed fourth downs on desperation drives. Four of the Ravens\u2019 nine turnovers on downs came on late-game possessions in which it trailed by at least two touchdowns.\u00a0\nBut Baltimore has also been mistake-prone in more high-leverage moments. Eleven of the Ravens\u2019 23 fourth-quarter playoff turnovers since 2008 have occurred when the scoring margin was within eight points, or one possession. Eight of those giveaways, Huntley\u2019s fumble being the latest, occurred during games Baltimore lost.\nThe other three turnovers in one-score games proved to be speed bumps throughout the Ravens\u2019 four-game run in the 2012 playoffs that culminated in the franchise\u2019s second Super Bowl title. Since then, Baltimore is just 3-6 in the postseason and has committed 11 additional fourth-quarter turnovers in those games.",

    "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs had failed to convert in the Red Zone drive after drive.\nFour times during regulation play, the Chiefs had worked their way inside the 49ers\u2019 20-yard line but on those drives had scored just nine points. Their only touchdown had come after recovering a fumbled punt.\nThen came overtime.\nWhen they needed it most, the Chiefs marched down the field for a touchdown led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes Sunday night, defeating the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in Super Bowl LVIII in front of an Allegiant Stadium crowd of 61,629.\nThe winning score, on a three-yard pass from Mahomes to Mecole Hardman with seconds remaining in the first overtime, gave Kansas City its third Super Bowl title in five years and second in a row.\nThe victory Sunday made the Chiefs the first back-to-back Super Bowl champs since the New England Patriots in 2003-4.\n\u201cDefensively our guys came out, played their hearts out. They did that all year and kept us in the game,\u201d Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThe offense just kind of persevered through it. Tough in the first half\u2026and then they got a little better in the second half.\u201d\nFor the Chiefs, it was a familiar script in a Super Bowl. In previous Super Bowl appearances with Mahomes at quarterback, Kansas City\u2019s offense had struggled early. Sunday might have been the slowest start of all. There were many missed opportunities and a fumble deep in 49ers territory by Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco thwarted one promising first-half drive.\nSan Francisco opened the scoring in the second quarter with a Super Bowl record 55-yard field goal by Jake Moody (a mark that Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker broke in the third quarter with a 57-yarder).\nThe 49ers then built a 10-0 lead on a trick play. With under five minutes in the first half, quarterback Brock Purdy lateraled to wide receiver Jauan Jennings who passed across the field to running back Christian McCaffrey who raced to the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown.\nThe Chiefs responded with a drive that ended in a Butker field goal from 28 yards with 20 seconds left in the half.\nIt was just a seven-point deficit for the Chiefs at the half, but Reid said it felt like a deeper hole. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the Super Bowl and you\u2019re down seven points it feels like 20,\u201d the Chiefs coach said. \u201cYou kind of just got to calm it down, we\u2019re right there.\u201d\nThe Chiefs started haltingly in the second half, too. But after a Mahomes interception, Kansas City recovered a 49ers fumble and Mahomes found Marquez Valdes-Scantling on the ensuing play for a 16-yard touchdown.\nOn the 49ers\u2019 next possession, Jennings caught a Purdy pass for a score, becoming just the second player to throw and pass for a touchdown in a Super Bowl after Nick Foles did in 2018. Kansas City blocked San Francisco\u2019s extra point to limit the 49ers lead to 16-13.\nThe blocked point-after proved crucial as it allowed the Chiefs to tie the game with a field goal. The two teams traded field goals in the final two minutes to take the Super Bowl to overtime for just the second time. San Francisco drove to the Kansas City nine-yard line, but the Chiefs defense held and the 49ers settled for a field goal.\nThen it was time for Mahomes to take control leading the Chiefs on a methodical 13-play, 75-yard drive \u2014 their longest of the night \u2014 that ended with Hardman pulling in the winning touchdown pass.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of great playoff runs,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cBut this is going to be up there, because just the way that we kind of continued to battle there when times weren\u2019t great.\u201d",

Despite awareness of injury risks, some youth football leaders believe the sport's positive impacts outweigh the dangers.",
    "content": "Tackle football offers children as young as 5 the chance to make friends, learn teamwork, maybe attract a college scholarship. It also can lead to injuries that can damage developing brains.\nThat leaves families to balance the risks against the opportunities. Many are opting out. Participation in youth tackle football has been declining for years. However, in other communities, especially in communities of color, tackle football\u2019s lure remains strong and the balance tips toward opportunity, a four-month investigation by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland has found.\nAmong the results of a nationwide Ipsos poll commissioned by the Povich and Howard centers:\n\nBlack parents are more likely than white parents, by substantial margins, to believe that youth tackle football could lead to a college scholarship or an NFL career. Hispanic parents are also far more likely than white parents to see college scholarships and pro careers as a potential benefit of youth football.\nNearly one in four Black parents said the appropriate age for children to start playing tackle football is 9 years old or younger. Only 14% of white parents answered that children should start at age 9 or younger.\nBlack parents are more likely than other parents polled to favor limiting contact in youth football practice to no more than 30 minutes per day.\n\nTerrence Byrd is the president of Maryland Heat, a youth tackle program that suits up boys as young as 5 in pads and helmets. He said he knows injuries are possible in tackle football, as they are in all sports, and he added his coaches are training children to play as safely as possible. But he believes the opportunities that youth football provides outweigh the risks.\n\u201cI would confidently say that we are changing lives,\u201d Byrd said.\nTrauma to developing brains\nMedical studies over the years have linked head trauma suffered by NFL players to a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with symptoms including dementia, depression, anxiety and aggression.\nLast year, the Boston University CTE Center released a study that said the danger isn\u2019t just to professional players. The developing brains of children are at risk for damage from repeated lower impacts to the head and brain, repeated impacts that have been associated with impulsive behaviors and cognitive problems in younger people.\nThe study notes that children who start playing tackle football at an early age or participate in the sport for more than 11 years run an increased risk of such impairment.\nThough hitting in youth football is less violent than at high school and college levels, it can be damaging to developing bodies, researchers found. A child\u2019s brain and head are disproportionately outsized for the rest of the body, especially from ages 5 to 8, and a child\u2019s weak neck cannot brace for a hit the way an adult\u2019s can, according to Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical diagnostics and therapeutics leader of the BU CTE Center and the author of more than 540 scientific articles on neurology and sports medicine.\nBecause youth necks are relatively weak, falling to the ground or turf and slamming a player\u2019s head can cause concussions as often as collisions with other players, Dr. Cantu said. Even repetitive hits to the head that aren\u2019t diagnosed as concussions can damage the brain, researchers found.\nNot all researchers agree, leaving room for skepticism. A recent study of 52 high school athletes found head impacts were not consistently associated with changes in cognitive, emotional or behavioral symptoms.\nDanielle Ransom, a pediatric neuropsychologist at Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, and one of the study\u2019s researchers, said the Boston University UNITE Brain Bank is \u201creally important science.\u201d BU\u2019s Brain Bank is \u201cthe largest tissue repository in the world focused on traumatic brain injury (TBI) and CTE.\u201d\nBut Ransom said that while head trauma contributes to CTE, other factors \u2014 including genetics and substance abuse \u2014 should also be considered.\nAt the University of Maryland, head football coach Michael Locksley said he feels the data is inconclusive and, \u201cfrom a medical standpoint, the game has been under attack.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you do the research, you can find the answers you want,\u201d he said in an interview with the Povich and Howard centers. However, \u201cIt\u2019s up to us as coaches and football people to figure out how to play it as safely as we can.\u201d\nLocksley went to Towson University on a football scholarship, becoming the first in his family to attend college. He met his wife, Kia, there and completed a marketing degree.\n\u201cThe game has given me a lot,\u201d he said.\nBut Locksley\u2019s history with football is complicated. In 2017, his son Meiko, who began playing tackle football at 7, died in a shooting at age 25. His parents donated his brain for examination at the Boston University CTE Center. The doctors found that Meiko Locksley showed signs of CTE.\nMary Seau, the sister of Hall of Fame NFL linebacker Junior Seau, said she believes the research. Junior Seau started playing tackle football when he was 8. He went to the University of Southern California on a football scholarship, and his NFL career spanned 20 years.\nIn 2012, Seau shot himself dead in his home in Oceanside, California. After analysis of her brother\u2019s brain found signs of CTE, Mary Seau said her family thought about his Pop Warner youth tackle football years.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that the brain is so fragile,\u201d Seau said.\nThough members of her family are still involved with the sport today, she doesn\u2019t watch football anymore. \u201cI have my nieces and nephews who can\u2019t talk about how their son played because they know how I am,\u201d Seau said.\nBenefits beyond the playing field\nSome supporters of youth football believe injuries can be reduced if coaches continue to limit the number of hits allowed during practices, saving more contact for the game. The Ipsos poll found 71% of parents \u2014 67% of white parents and 77% of Black parents \u2014 agreed with \u201climiting full-contact practice for youth tackle football to no more than twice per week.\u201d\nSome parents are opting to enroll their children in leagues that play flag football, which limits contact on the field. Others believe players should not be introduced to tackle football until high school.\nBut youth tackle leagues remain popular in many parts of the country. Todd Casey, commissioner of Vienna (Virginia) Youth, Inc. Football, said enrollment has steadily increased in the football program. \u201cRight now, we have our largest enrollment in tackle football that we\u2019ve had since 2014,\u201d he said.\nIn Fort Washington, Maryland, parents who were watching the Heat practice said they\u2019ve considered the dangers and believe the risk of injury is no greater in football than other sports. They said coaches are careful to keep their children safe and the players are gaining a lot from the game, with benefits accruing far off the field.\n\u201cThey make new friends, experience new things,\u201d Stephanie Rogers said on a fall evening as she watched her son, DeCarlo, 15, and his Maryland Heat teammates run through plays. \u201cThe sum of those types of benefits that aren\u2019t necessarily the winning-the-game part, but you know what they get out of it.\u201d\nBeyond the social benefits, Rogers said, the Heat program provides opportunities for a better education. \u201cWe have private high schools trying to get these kids in their doors,\u201d she said.\nTerrence Byrd speaks to his 14U team after practice in Fort Washington, Maryland on November 9, 2023. Photo by Torrence Banks/University of Maryland\nDeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, is one of the private schools that recruits Maryland Heat players. Last year, 19 of DeMatha\u2019s football players signed with Division I and II college football programs. Tuition is $21,900, said Bill McGregor, DeMatha\u2019s football coach. The school does not offer athletic scholarships, he said, but families can apply for financial aid.\nAt the Heat practice, two parents had driven from Delaware and another from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a trip of more than two hours, which the parent makes three times a week.\n\u201cYou\u2019re now changing the education paradigm for young men,\u201d said Byrd, the coach, \u201cand you\u2019re changing their exposure to colleges,\u201d by giving the players experience that can attract scholarships.\nThough some Heat players\u2019 parents can afford to pay steep prices for equipment, some families can\u2019t afford to pay the program\u2019s $250 flat fee \u2014 which includes equipment \u2014 to participate for the entire season. In some cases, the program raises money to cover those children\u2019s fees.\nJerome Montgomery, of Waldorf, Maryland, researches the safest equipment for his son Micah\u2019s practices \u2014 from pads to helmets. Montgomery said helmets can run up to $700 each.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather pay a lot of money for the helmets than for a hospital visit,\u201d he said.\nThe risk of injuries, Byrd said, exists in all sports. And many of the children in his league face dangers off the field \u2014 \u201cwhether it\u2019s at risk for taking a shot to the head at a football game, or whether it\u2019s at risk to taking, you know, a shot on the streets.\u201d\nConsidering the risks\nRogers, a nurse, said she knows the risks of football. \u201cI used to work in the operating room. I know a lot about head trauma and mental health issues that can stem from trauma. \u2026 I guess you always have that in the back of your mind.\u201d But the worry is \u201cnot enough to not let them play.\u201d\nRogers added she trusts the quality of the equipment and appreciates Byrd\u2019s dedication to including safety precautions in practice.\nMaryland Heat running back Santana Campfield, 9, takes a breather after practice in Fort Washington, Maryland, on Nov. 9, 2023. Photo by Torrence Banks/University of Maryland\nShakia Johnson\u2019s son, Nasir, 15, has had injuries: a broken leg, hyperextended knees, other aches and pains. His parents take him to a chiropractor and he does cryotherapy and yoga. \u201cWe actually invest a lot in his body,\u201d Johnson said.\nHis teammate, Phyve Linder, 14, started playing tackle football at 5. He\u2019s recovered from an ankle injury that happened when he made a tackle. And he said last year he saw a player taken off the field with a concussion.\nHe said that didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cI still wanted to play because I love the game. I love playing the game. It didn\u2019t really change my mind at all because I\u2019ve seen it multiple times,\u201d Linder said.\nThough flag football may be a safer alternative, Mac Stephens, former NFL player and coach at Cleveland Heights High School in Ohio, said he doesn\u2019t believe this substitution would work for the majority of parents in urban areas.\nIf Cleveland Heights didn\u2019t offer tackle football before high school, Stephens said, parents would find leagues in other towns for their kids to play in.\nParents, he said, believe, \u201cWell, I have to get my son on track to get a college scholarship someday.\u201d\nStephens, co-president of the North Coast Youth Football Conference, said the Cleveland-based league is 90% to 95% Black and is thriving, with several of its teams seeing an increase in participation.\nAnother former NFL player takes a different view. Solomon Brannan, who played in the first Super Bowl (then called the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game), in 1967, said flag football could teach young players about teamwork and strategy just as well as tackle, and with far fewer risks.\nA former head coach at Morris Brown College and assistant coach at Morehouse College, Brannan has marched with several organizations to Capitol Hill as part of Brain Injury Awareness Month in March to highlight the dangers of the sport.\nA financial factor\nMoney, Brannan said, motivates parents who are hoping for scholarships. But instead of focusing on athletics, he said, parents should be spending time with their kids and books.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t depend on sports,\u201d Brannan said, \u201cbut if you\u2019ve got it upstairs in your head, you\u2019re going to be successful no matter what.\u201d\nDr. Samantha Bureau, director of international programs at the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said that deciding to play tackle football does not mean players are indifferent about their health.\n\u201cI just think some people maybe are not as fortunate to be thinking about their long-term health in the current moment based on their current situation,\u201d she said.\nAt the University of Maryland, Michael Locksley said his wife, Kia, now believes children should not play tackle football before 14. But Michael Locksley disagrees.\nFootball, he said, \u201cis the closest sport to mimicking life. In football, you get knocked down. You can get tackled, and you\u2019ve got to get back up and you\u2019ve got to face it the next play.\u201d\nIf his grandchildren want to play the game, Locksley said, he will support them. But it\u2019s their parents who will decide if the kids will suit up and play tackle.\n\nCredit: Freddy Wolfe, Judith Altneu and Christine Folivi",

    "content": "Most parents understand the health risks of tackle football for children, but a new poll found significant differences in how Black, Hispanic and white parents of children under 18 view the benefits the game offers.\nBlack and Hispanic parents are nearly twice as likely as white parents to see youth football as a path to college scholarships and even to the NFL.\nThe poll, conducted by Ipsos, showed Black, white and Hispanic parents agree that youth tackle football helps children make friends, learn teamwork and become physically fit.\n\nBut then the results diverge by race.\nThe poll showed that 23% of white parents of children under 18 see the possibility of a scholarship as one of the game\u2019s biggest benefits. That\u2019s compared to 43% of Black parents and 42% of Hispanic parents who said the possibility of a college scholarship is one of youth football\u2019s biggest advantages.\nThirteen percent of white parents of children under 18 said they see the possibility of playing professionally as one of the biggest benefits to kids\u2019 playing tackle football. But that percentage is far higher among Black parents \u2013 35% \u2013 and Hispanic parents \u2013 37%.\n\nMallory Newall, vice president at Ipsos, said that while the poll shows Black and Hispanic parents are more likely to see the monetary benefits of the sport, the parents see learning teamwork, commitment and physical fitness as bigger benefits.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a period where sports are being monetized like never before, both from the perspective of the NIL [allowing college and high school athletes to market their names, images and likenesses] and gambling,\u201d Newall said. \u201cAnd so I think, Black and Hispanic parents have shown that perhaps they\u2019re a bit more attuned to that as a potential benefit.\u201d\nThe poll found that most parents of children under 18 would let their children play tackle football even though the parents said they understand the health risks. Sixty-one percent of white parents said they would allow their child to play, as compared to 66% of Black parents.\nThe poll found a large majority of parents, Black and white, believe that children should not begin playing tackle football until they are 10 or older.\nHowever, 12% of Black parents of children under 18 said that 5 to 7 years old was an appropriate age to begin playing tackle, as compared with 5% of white parents and 6% of Hispanic parents.\nA significant percentage of parents in the poll would not let children play tackle at all. Twenty-four percent of Hispanic parents said that children under 18 should not be allowed to play tackle football, with 21% of white parents agreeing. Among Black parents, 13% said children under 18 should not be allowed to play.\nMedical researchers who study brain disorders related to concussion, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), said the number of years that children play tackle football is important. A recent study from the Boston University CTE Center found that playing for 11 years or more increases the chances of developing brain-related problems, including aggressive behaviors, depression and dementia.\nAs part of its \u201cDon\u2019t Hit Kids\u201d initiative, the Concussion Legacy Foundation recommends that children wait to play tackle football until they turn 14.\nThe poll, conducted by Ipsos for The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland, was conducted in November and included interviews with 1,655 Americans. Of those, 876 are parents of children under 18.\nThe margin of error for participants overall is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for all parents of children under 18.\nThe poll found that parents of children under 18 believe the medical findings about football-related brain injuries are conclusive. Seventy-nine percent of Black parents, 81% of white parents and 77% of Hispanic parents answered that they believe playing football is dangerous for young people.\nBut millions of parents allow their children to play tackle football.\nAmong parents of children who have played sports, 11% of Black parents said their child has had a concussion diagnosed by a medical professional, as compared to 5% of white parents and 6% of Hispanic parents.\nFor all parents, the poll suggests there is room for education on the dangers of head injuries that occur during games or in practice. Seventy percent of parents of children under 18 said they did not know that youth athletes experience an average of eight head impacts a season playing flag or tackle football.\nSixty-four percent of parents of children under 18 said they did not know that tackle football players ages 6 to 14 sustained significantly more head impacts during practices or games than flag players in the same age group.\nJohnny Sawyer, research manager at Ipsos, said he was surprised by how little parents knew about the extent of the dangers football poses.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room for educating parents,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cThe poll shows that parents know that playing football can lead to head injuries. Once you sort of stray away from that basic fact, there\u2019s not a lot of knowledge out there.\u201d\nAcross the board, parents of children under 18 said they are worried about the risks tackle football presents. Ninety-two percent of all parents said they were concerned that \u201crepeated head impacts can lead to traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and result in long-term problems, including ongoing problems with concentration, memory, and headaches.\u201d\nNinety-one percent of parents of children under 18 are concerned that playing tackle football for more than 11 years can potentially cause \u201cimpulsive behavior and other thinking-related problems.\u201d\nAnd 91% of parents of children under 18 also said they are concerned that helmets do not provide excellent protection against concussions and other brain injuries.\nOverall, people interviewed for the poll said football is less dangerous than living with a smoker, riding in a car without a seatbelt or riding in a car with a distracted driver.\nThey said football is more dangerous for children than baseball, gymnastics, soccer or jumping on a trampoline.\nAnd a majority of respondents said though they know the risks associated with football, they still enjoy watching it.",

    "summary": "In rural Mississippi, football remains a crucial activity for young boys, offering a path to college and potential escape from poverty despite limited recreational options and safety concerns. Despite the challenges, three players from the small town of Lexington have made it to elite college programs, highlighting the sport's significance as a beacon of hope in the community.",
    "content": "LEXINGTON, Miss. \u2014 A winter sun is setting over the brown, patchy field where Ronald Redmond\u2019s kids have been playing football since they were 5. Trash is piled under the stands, the goalposts are rusting and the fence is ripped. But Redmond knows what kids who played on this field have gone on to achieve: high school stardom, college scholarships and even NFL glory.\n\u201cStay on that football field,\u201d Redmond recalls telling his 11-year-old son, R.J., a center and linebacker on the Lexington Colts youth football team. \u201cYou can go somewhere with that. \u2026 If you dedicate yourself to this football and your education, then you can go wherever you want.\u201d\nTackle football is among the only recreational activities available to kids in Lexington and surrounding Holmes County, the second-poorest county in the nation\u2019s poorest state. There are no swimming pools, no tennis courts, no soccer fields, no YMCAs.\n\u201cThe opportunity for kids is at a bare minimum,\u201d Redmond said.\n\nParents have good reason to believe in what football offers. According to an analysis by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland, three players on 2023 Power Five college football rosters were from Lexington, where the population is 1,154.\nPut another way: One out of every 385 people from this majority-Black country town in central Mississippi played for an elite college program. It\u2019s the best per capita rate of any town with at least 250 people in the state \u2014 and among the top rates in the nation.\nAs safety concerns prompt a debate over youth football, there are many reasons the sport endures in Lexington. At a minimum, football is a structured activity that teaches discipline, gives kids something to do and keeps them out of trouble. At best, it\u2019s a path to college, a chance at a better life and a way out.\nThe odds of making it are long and the health risks are real, but in Lexington, many people take their chances with football.\n\u201cFootball is a highlight of this community,\u201d said Paul Reeves, whose family oversees the Lexington Colts, \u201cbecause for a lot of us, that\u2019s all we have.\u201d\n\u2018We want to give hope\u2019\nWillie Reeves was a pastor who knew that without structured activity, kids in his hometown could get drawn into a life of crime and violence. So in 1999, he started the Lexington Colts, hoping football would steer kids in a positive direction.\nSince Willie Reeves\u2019 death in 2017, the Colts have continued under the stewardship of his wife, Sherri, and their sons, Peter and Paul. Last year, with a strained budget and with no financial support from the city, the Colts enrolled nearly 40 kids between the ages of 5 and 12. The program has also organized clothing drives and food programs for the county, where the median household income is less than $29,000 a year.\n\u201cWe want to give hope to the kids in our area,\u201d said Paul Reeves, the Colts\u2019 defensive coordinator. \u201cTheir talent can get wasted if they get involved with the wrong type of activities. And even worse, they can lose their lives at a young age.\u201d\nIn a town where 76% of residents are African American, every child who played last season for the Colts was Black. Only two white children have signed up in the program\u2019s 25 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really very little intermingling socially among the kids that are Black and white in this community,\u201d Sherri Reeves said. \u201cAnd we got firsthand of that.\u201d\nFrom her home in Lexington, Mississippi, Sherri Reeves looks through a collection of photos and clippings from the Lexington Colts, a youth football organization that she runs with her sons, Peter and Paul. Photo by Jenna Bloom/University of Maryland\nIt\u2019s not just football. There are signs of a racial divide throughout Lexington, where a Confederate monument looms over the town square, the police department is under federal investigation for civil rights violations and the schools are segregated.\nAt S.V. Marshall Middle School, a public school where R.J. Redmond is a sixth-grader, Black students number 345, with four white students and one Native American/Alaska Native. R.J.\u2019s brothers, Mason, 7, and Kingston, 5, attend William Dean Jr. Elementary, where 97% of students are Black.\nMeanwhile, white children make up 82% of the enrollment at Central Holmes Christian School, a K-12 private school located on Robert E. Lee Drive, which segregationists established to circumvent integration mandates.\nThe chance for a scholarship\nParents are drawn to the Colts in part because they hear about the program\u2019s success stories \u2014 people like Corey Ellington, a former Colt who is now a safety at Mississippi State University. Or D.J. Montgomery, an NFL wide receiver. Or Terrance Hibbler, one of the top high school players in the state.\n\nHibbler received at least 18 college scholarship offers before deciding he would join Ellington next season at Mississippi State in Starkville, about 100 miles from home.\nThe possibilities are what convinced Redmond to enroll his sons in youth football.\n\u201cI just paid attention to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned that the earlier they get into it, the better they\u2019ll be on the field. So I just couldn\u2019t wait for the opportunity to present itself.\u201d\nMarcus Rogers, the head football coach at Holmes County Central High School in Lexington, attends youth football games \u2014 to support the team but also \u201cto see what the future may hold.\u201d\nRogers has made it his mission to help kids at Holmes County Central get into college. He estimates that in six seasons, 60 of his players have earned scholarships to colleges across the country, from the University of South Alabama to New Mexico State University.\nEven legendary former University of Alabama coach Nick Saban made a handful of recruiting trips to Lexington. \u201cIf I got a thoroughbred, I know how to market him,\u201d Rogers said.\nFor people in Holmes County, he added, football \u201cgives them something to be positive about. It gives them something to brag about.\u201d\n\nPowerful obstacles\nCardell Wright, president of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, a local civil rights organization, said for kids in Holmes County who don\u2019t pursue sports, the options are limited. \u201cOutside of that, then you either go into academics,\u201d he said, \u201cor, you don\u2019t do anything at all.\u201d\nLocal colleges, including Jackson State University, Mississippi State University and Holmes Community College, offer academic scholarships to high school students who achieve minimum ACT scores. But according to the Mississippi Department of Education, just 20% of students at Holmes County Central met ACT benchmarks last year for college and career readiness, compared to 49% statewide.\nThe numbers reflect broader concerns with the county\u2019s public schools, which were failing and taken over by the state in 2021. In their first year of college, 2020 graduates of Holmes County Central had lower GPAs than the state average and were more likely to require remedial instruction, the educational data shows. Four in 10 were no longer enrolled in college after one year.\nThe Lexington Colts youth football organization, featuring kids ages 5-12, plays its games on this grass field, pictured here on Jan. 3, 2024.

Photo by Jenna Bloom/University of Maryland\n\u201cWhether you\u2019ve got sports or not, it\u2019s a challenge for kids leaving places like Holmes County, moving into life because there\u2019s so many things they have to overcome,\u201d said Rep. Bryant Clark, who represents Holmes County in the Mississippi legislature.\nThey\u2019re the kind of obstacles that reinforce the community\u2019s commitment to football. Clark, who serves on the board of the Lexington Colts, said youth football isn\u2019t just about setting up a few kids for stardom. It\u2019s about opening doors.\n\u201cFootball and sports afford them opportunities to be able to go to college [and] get a free education,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd whether they go further out after college in football is one thing, but the sky\u2019s the limit as far as being able to get out of college, have a degree and be able to be a productive citizen.\u201d\nWright, the civil rights leader, agreed football offers many benefits as a galvanizing force for the community and a path to a better life. But like many others, he wishes there was more. \u201cThe thing that we\u2019re trying to do in this area is present the kids with more options,\u201d Wright said, \u201cbecause everybody is not going to be basketball and football players.\u201d\nLast year, the county received some good news: Holmes County Central earned a B grade on the state\u2019s annual report card, an achievement it marks on a sign outside the school. \u201cIt really represented that our kids are not hopeless,\u201d Wright said. He hopes it persuades officials to invest in kids in Holmes County and expand opportunities in the arts and sports.\nIn the meantime, there\u2019s football.\n\u201cThat can be you out there on that field,\u201d Redmond remembers telling his sons as they watched an NFL game. \u201cIt all boils down to what you want. If you want it, you can get it.\u201d",

Winning would represent a proud achievement in sports-crazed Gwinnett County, where over 3,200 children ages 6-15, along with 850 volunteer coaches, took part in the GFL\u2019s 2023 football season.\nA growing body of evidence is pointing to the dangers of sustaining repetitive hits through contact sports. A recent Boston University study found that even young, amateur-level athletes could be at risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated blows to the head. Those who played football and did so over many years were more likely to be diagnosed, the study found.\nIn Buford and Gwinnett County, parents, coaches and league administrators have acknowledged playing football comes with some risks. They\u2019ve even attempted to mitigate them. But they\u2019ve also determined the joys, rituals and opportunities that come with the game are worth preserving. It\u2019s why football remains a thriving and cherished tradition in Buford, passed on to successive generations by the time kids reach elementary school.\nA J McDonald participated in the GFL from ages 7-13 and works today as an attorney. Playing football caused him to experience headaches as a kid. In high school, he suffered his first of \u201cprobably three\u201d concussions in his career. \u201cYou should see my helmets,\u201d the former linebacker and fullback said.\nStill, McDonald would have no reservations if his son, who was born in July, wanted to someday follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.\n\u201cYou\u2019re out there, it\u2019s like blood, sweat and tears,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special bond \u2014 there\u2019s nothing like a football bond. I\u2019m friends with kids that I played with on my 8-year-old team. It\u2019s just something different.\u201d\n\u2018Sports run the town\u2019\nBuford, a town of 16,800 residents located one hour north of Atlanta, excels at producing elite football talent, according to a Capital News Service analysis of rosters from the five most prominent college conferences.\nDuring the 2023 season, 23 Power Five college football players were from Buford, the analysis found. They took the field for distinguished programs across the country \u2014 the University of Alabama, the University of Nebraska, Michigan State University and Stanford University, among them. In all, Buford produced more Power Five players than 12 states and Washington, D.C.\nBuford\u2019s success and reputation as a football town begins with a robust youth sports culture. With nearly 400 players, the Buford Youth Football Association is the largest of 20 Gwinnett County organizations that form the GFL.\nGames and practices are held at the Buford Youth Sports Complex, which is set to undergo an estimated $1.5 million renovation this offseason to its lighting system and synthetic turf fields, according to Ken Burge, a third-generation Buford resident who serves as football director of the Buford Youth Football Association.\n\n\u201cYou look around at all the buildings, look at the facilities \u2014 they believe in youth sports,\u201d said Phillip Ely, who started Rise Flag Football, a Buford-based league, with his wife, Kallie. \u201cThey believe in sports, in general. Sports basically run the town.\u201d\nBuford and other GFL associations serve as a pipeline to the area\u2019s high school programs, said Gerald \u201cBoo\u201d Mitchell, president of the GFL. Starting as young as 6 years old, players wear the colors, run the plays and learn the traditions of the high school teams.\nIn Buford, the youth program aims to cultivate the next wave of talent for Buford High School, a 14-time state champion whose accomplishments stand as a source of community pride.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a video they play before every high school football game,\u201d Burge said. It depicts \u201cwhen you\u2019re a child laying in your bed at night dreaming of putting on the gold helmet for Buford. That\u2019s where it starts, and we try to carry that.\u201d\nTo many in Buford and the GFL, football is not just a sport. \u201cI look at football as an opportunity to really build life skills \u2026 accountability, respect, team building,\u201d said Buford Webb coach Markell Webb, whose 7-year-old son Mic\u00e1ias, played on the team in the 2023 season. They argue that football\u2019s unique elements \u2014 the way players put on pads, play through adverse weather and hit each other \u2014 offer lessons that other sports can\u2019t teach.\n\u201cIf you can make it through football and play football, you can do anything in the world,\u201d Mitchell said.\nMitchell said he\u2019s encountered many who have built their careers based on their experiences in the GFL. Founded in 1981, the league counts several prominent NFL players as alums, including Bradley Roby, Alvin Kamara, and brothers Cameron and Connor Heyward. Others go on to become football trainers or coaches.\nFor McDonald, his youth and high school careers earned him a football scholarship to Appalachian State University. He later transferred to the University of Georgia, where his coach, Mark Richt, wrote him a letter of recommendation for law school. Football, McDonald said, \u201cprepares you for life, and it opens doors.\u201d\nNo more \u2018smash-mouth\u2019\nBuford Webb called one of its final practices before the GFL championship \u201cCompetition Tuesday.\u201d For much of the 90-minute session, shoulder pads and helmets clacked and thwacked as pint-sized players reviewed how to beat a double team or pursue a running back. \u201cWe missed too many tackles last week,\u201d one coach lamented of the team\u2019s performance in the GFL semifinals, a 19-0 victory over Norcross.\n\nMitchell said despite the hits, youth practices like Competition Tuesday look much different than they did in the past, part of the GFL\u2019s attempts to make the sport safer. Full-contact practices are limited across the league to twice a week. Coaches who violate this rule are subject to suspensions and fines of $1,000 or more.\n\u201cWe love to see how football used to be played \u2026 but you have to understand that the game has changed,\u201d said Keybo Taylor, a former GFL coach who today serves as the sheriff of Gwinnett County. \u201cThese kids are bigger now. They\u2019re faster now. These collisions are more violent. \u2026 I think it\u2019s a good thing that at all levels, they\u2019re doing things to protect these players.\u201d\nThe GFL also regulates the kinds of collisions permitted on practice days, banning the violent, \u201csmash-mouth\u201d drills that were common in previous eras. For Buford Webb, Competition Tuesday featured a combination of live contact, as well as several lower-intensity drills with foam tackling dummies and wheels.\n\u201cSome of the drills you ran back in the day, you can\u2019t do them anymore,\u201d Webb said. \u201cYou\u2019re not running kids from 20 yards back and slamming them through walls. \u2026 It\u2019s a really controlled environment.\u201d\nBut even as youth teams in Buford and the GFL try to mitigate the risks of football, there is also a perception that the dangers are overstated, especially for the youngest kids.\nBurge questions the scrutiny placed on football, given that vicious collisions also take place in sports like lacrosse and soccer. Webb said the 6- and 7-year-olds he coaches are more likely to get injured from freak accidents on the field than from collisions. None of his players suffered a concussion or serious injury this season, he said.\n\u201cAt this age, they don\u2019t hit hard enough,\u201d said Jimmy Williams, whose 7-year-old son, Christopher, played this season for Buford Webb. \u201cIt\u2019s all fun. Most of the time, they\u2019re walking bobbleheads.\u201d\n\u2018It never stops\u2019\nBuford Webb\u2019s appearance in the GFL championship game was a momentous enough occasion that Dylan Raiola, star quarterback at Buford High School, showed up to the team\u2019s practice to give a motivational speech.\nRaiola isn\u2019t the average high school standout \u2014 he is one of the top prospects in the country and has signed to play for the University of Nebraska. To the onlooking parents, Raiola\u2019s appearance came with a clear message: A dozen more years of playing football in Buford, and this could be your kid.\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure that [the kids] knew that I was rooting for them and supporting them,\u201d Raiola said, before signing autographs and posing for pictures.\nBuford Webb won the GFL title a few days later, defeating Lawrenceville, 24-6. Despite rainy conditions and an 8 a.m. start time, Webb estimated that hundreds of Buford fans came to cheer on the team. Players received championship rings, celebrated at the local arcade and were featured in the Gwinnett Daily Post, the local newspaper.\n\u201cThey feel like local celebrities,\u201d Webb said.\nThe GFL is in its offseason, but football in Buford and Gwinnett County goes on. Parents pay for kids to work with private trainers. Children compete in all-star games and youth competitions throughout the winter and spring. Rise Flag Football serves as an outlet for hundreds of kids, many in the GFL, to hone their skills during the offseason, according to Kallie Ely.\n\u201cThis is a 365-day-a-year football community,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt never stops.\u201d",

    "content": "On Nov. 14, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced Chelsea\u2019s Emma Hayes as the replacement for Vlatko Andonovski as the U.S. women\u2019s national team (USWNT) head coach. She will take over at the conclusion of this season.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThis is a huge honor to be given the opportunity to coach the most incredible team in world football history,\u201d Hayes said in the announcement. \u201cThe feelings and connection I have for this team and for this country run deep. I\u2019ve dreamed about coaching the USA for a long time so to get this opportunity is a dream come true.\u201d\nDuring her time as Chelsea head coach, after joining them during the 2012 Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) season, she became one of the most decorated coaches in the history of soccer.\nAfter losing the league to Liverpool on goal difference in 2014, she went on to win six WSL titles in eight years, including each of the last four. She was named WSL Manager of the Season each of those six years, making her the only one to win the award more than once.\n\nHayes led Chelsea to their first-ever Women\u2019s FA Cup triumph in 2015 after beating Notts County 1-0 in the final. She\u2019s since won the trophy four other times, giving her the most FA Cups of any other WSL coach.\nShe also won Chelsea their first ever FA Women\u2019s Continental League Cup (Conti Cup) in 2020 after a 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the final. She went on to defend the trophy in 2021.\n\nHayes\u2019 Chelsea has won the \u201cdouble\u201d \u2013 FA Cup or Conti Cup in addition to a WSL title \u2013 five times, more than any other team. Additionally, she picked up the domestic treble \u2013 all three major trophies \u2013 in 2021, becoming only the second team to do so after Arsenal in 2011.\nDespite having yet to win the Women\u2019s Champions League, Hayes led Chelsea to their first-ever final in 2021. These efforts, along with the treble, led her to be recognized at the prestigious Best FIFA Football Awards, where she was named the Best FIFA Women\u2019s Coach of 2021.\nWith all her success at Chelsea, Hayes became the first manager inducted into the WSL Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class of 2021.\nWhy the USWNT needs Hayes\nWith an impressive four FIFA World Cup wins, the USWNT has always been a powerhouse of soccer. In every edition of the tournament from 1991 to 2019, they breezed through their group and placed in the top three.\nHowever, during the most recent summer\u2019s installment, the USWNT, led by Andonovski, failed to impress. Not only did they scrape through group qualification by a single point, but they were eliminated in the first knockout round in a 5-4 penalty shootout defeat to Sweden, which confirmed their first-ever exit prior to the semi-finals.\nThe team showed a lack of clinical edge throughout. Despite having 84 shots with 25 on target across the four games, the team only scored four goals, averaging 0.92 goals per 90, their lowest ever at a World Cup.\n\nLess than two weeks after being eliminated, Andonovski resigned as the head coach.\nDuring her time at Chelsea, Hayes created one of the best attacks in the history of the WSL with 482 goals in 190 games, an average of 2.5 goals per game.\nShe also has an impressive track record with coaching forwards. At Chelsea, she helped bring out the best qualities in talents such as Golden Boot winner Eniola Aluko, all-time leading Chelsea goalscorer Fran Kirby, two-time Golden Boot winner Sam Kerr and popular PFA Women\u2019s Young Player of the Year Lauren James.\nShe does this while maintaining an impressive defensive record, only conceding 0.83 goals per game, which is the fourth-least of every manager in the WSL.\n\nHayes\u2019 ability to have a strong defensive and offensive team can be down to her tactical flexibility. According to The Coaches Voice, she played a variety of formations in her years as Chelsea manager, switching from using four defenders to three in the 2021-2022 season.\nThis can also be down to how she instills a dominant playing style. Between 2018 and 2023, Chelsea averaged at least 57% possession consistently, according to the Coaches Voice.\nHayes is known to take a more personable approach to coaching her players. She reportedly made a great impression on the USWNT players during a meeting at the most recent camp.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for this team to be able to meet her, to get to know her,\u201d Chelsea and USWNT forward Mia Fishel said according to The Athletic. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing person, amazing coach. She\u2019s very funny.\u201d\n\u201cShe has a good balance between being serious and being light-hearted,\u201d Fishel said.\nOn her serious side, Hayes has a strict \u201cno excuses\u201d policy when it comes to poor performances from her players. She told The Coaches Voice that she\u2019ll always ask players if they need clarification.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that that has really really improved driving performance, because then it\u2019s putting the responsibility back on the player,\u201d Hayes said.\nHayes still expresses the need for coaches to also look to themselves to make sure they\u2019ve provided all the tools necessary before a game.\n\u201cThe only way you can hold them accountable is have you [the coach] done your job? That\u2019s what I\u2019ll always say to my staff is after every game we have to get our mirrors out and we have to say \u2018what could we have done better?\u2019 And we have to be honest about that,\u201d Hayes told the Coaches\u2019 Voice.\nHayes will begin her reign as the new USWNT head coach before this summer\u2019s Olympic Games.",

Coach Brenda Frese stresses that maximizing possessions and maintaining good offensive chemistry are crucial for achieving this ratio.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 When Maryland women\u2019s basketball hosted Niagara on Nov. 30 at the Xfinity Center, it ended with 30 assists, 17 turnovers and a 1.7 assist-to-turnover ratio; that many assists played a key role in its 70-point win. Maryland head coach Brenda Frese was elated about the Terps\u2019 performance and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great step in the right direction with our chemistry.\u201d\u00a0\nIf fans listened to Frese\u2019s press conferences this season and last, they\u2019d often hear her mention the team\u2019s assist-to-turnover ratio.\nThe assist-to-turnover ratio is a niche stat that measures ball security and offensive efficiency of a team or player. Getting the ratio is simple math: assists divided by turnovers. Teams want to have more assists than turnovers.\nShe often says Maryland having a good assist-to-turnover ratio leads to wins. In games that involved at least one Big Ten team over the last five years, Maryland owns four of the 10 highest ratios; the Terps won all of those games.\n\nMaryland advanced to the Elite Eight last year and data shows it played efficient basketball along the way.\nThe Terps ended last season with 589 assists and 347 turnovers; a 1.2 assist-to-turnover ratio, demonstrating good ball security. It was the team\u2019s second-best mark of the last five years, ranked sixth among Power Five schools last year and finishing with 28 wins.\u00a0\n\nThe average assist-to-turnover ratio in the Big Ten over the last five years was 1.2, placing Maryland\u2019s performance last year squarely in the middle.\nFrese said the key to having a good ratio is maximizing possessions.\n\u201cIf you have a positive assist-to-turnover ratio, you\u2019re not giving possessions away to be able to score the basketball. I also think it lends to your offensive chemistry that you\u2019re being unselfish to make the right play,\u201d Frese said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to make good plays. We want to make great plays (and) be hard to guard.\u201d\nGraduate student guard Brinae Alexander, who has an assist-to-turnover ratio of 0.6, agreed that a good ratio breeds chemistry. When she\u2019s able to set up her teammates for open shots and get an assist it aids in the flow of the game.\n\u201cHaving that positive assist-to-turnover ratio helps us keep the momentum in the game as far as making sure we\u2019re getting steals to score and we\u2019re making the extra pass and making us harder to guard,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big emphasis for us to keep positive.\u201d\nMaryland started last season with a strong ratio but it improved to a 1.5 in December. Its 24 assists against Rutgers were its highest of the season, and its highest ratio was a 3.8 in a win over UConn.\nMaryland went through a handful of injuries and struggles with many new players joining the roster last year. A seven-game win streak deep in conference play revitalized the team as the Big Ten tournament approached. During that stretch, its ratio was a 1.3 while its opponents had a combined ratio lower than one.\nGraduate student guard Eliza Pinzan had the best ratio on Maryland last year and was top 30 in the country. She was a skilled passer and didn\u2019t commit many turnovers.\nIn the end, Maryland was the third most efficient team in the Big Ten last season in terms of assist-to-turnover ratio. The greater the gap between a team\u2019s ratio and their opponent\u2019s, the more efficient or inefficient a team in terms of ball control. Iowa was the conference leader in assist-to-turnover ratio and had a spot in the NCAA championship game with LSU, another efficient team.\n\nMaryland has a 4-3 record so far this year and, through those seven games, a ratio of just under one. The Terps have played a daunting opening schedule with games against two AP-Top 10 teams, both of which they lost. They\u2019ve also graduated some of their best players such as Pinzan, Abby Meyers and Diamond Miller and are now trying new options at point guard. Maryland ended the two-game skid with a 1.2 ratio and beat Syracuse on Nov. 19.\nFilter the chart below by conference to see where your favorite team lands on the assist-to-turnover ratio scale.",

Washington, D.C., also allows high school athletes to sign endorsement deals.\nMany high school athletes with NIL deals have attracted sponsors with their standout play. Some deals can also be partly credited to family ties.\nKiyomi McMiller became the first high school athlete to sign an NIL deal with Jordan Brand in February. The point guard, who is from Silver Spring, was named as the No. 6 prospect in ESPN\u2019s 2024 player rankings. She currently plays for Life Center Academy in New Jersey and.has not committed to a college.\u00a0\n\nKiyomi McMiller becomes the first high school athlete to sign with Jordan Brand \ud83d\udc5f\ud83d\udcc8 #ThatsaW\n(\ud83d\udcf8: Jordan Brand) pic.twitter.com/WGqx2y5vE8\n\u2014 espnW (@espnW) February 22, 2023\n\nEwing\u2019s NIL deal with College Hunks Hauling Junk & Moving came as a result of Weaver reaching out to the co-founder of the company who was her high school classmate. Ewing believes the experience could help her secure more deals in the future, potentially at the college level. Ewing committed to Penn State in September.\n\u201cNIL is such a great platform for athletes to showcase who they are as people not on the field or on the court,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that you align yourself with a company that you really believe in and you have some familiarity with and they\u2019re doing great things for the community.\u201d\nEwing and McMiller\u2019s endorsements are their only deals. McMiller said she\u2019s in negotiations for three additional NIL agreements. Neither Ewing or McMiller would disclose their compensation from the companies.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing with a brand has taught me how to be a professional a little bit, because I\u2019m being around different people that work with NBA players and work with different brands and understand the business part of basketball,\u201d McMiller said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a lot, and I\u2019m learning it early.\u201d\nEwing and McMiller\u2019s deals are with companies that are accustomed to working with college athletes. College Hunks Hauling Junk & Moving has agreements with multiple college teams including Howard men\u2019s basketball. Jordan Brand\u2019s first NIL athlete was UCLA guard Kiki Rice. Carter said it\u2019s riskier for regional businesses to invest in local high school athletes because they commonly leave their current market to attend college.\nArchbishop Spalding football coach Kyle Schmitt, who helped lead the Cavaliers to an MIAA A conference championship last year, believes that with guidelines and guidance, all high school athletes should be allowed to profit from their image.\n\u201cHow you manage it as a school and a family and a coach is obviously going to be scrutinized and it\u2019s going to be really important,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cBut if these kids have an opportunity, I don\u2019t want to take anything away from our kids. We want to promote the heck out of our athletes, they\u2019re what makes high school sports great.\u201d\nWeaver and McMiller are examples of high school athletes who received considerable advice before signing their NIL deals. In her negotiations with Jordan Brand, McMiller was represented by Divine Sports & Entertainment co-founders Ryan Williams-Jenkins and Michael De Sane, according to On3. The agency represents eight NFL players and four college athletes.\nWeaver said that she sought legal advice before allowing her daughter to enter into her deal with College Hunks.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to make sure you\u2019re not signing anything that\u2019s basically for your life. You may be signing something in the small print that says that any money you make from any company or any NIL deals you make the rest of your life, they get a percentage of that,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cYou just have to make sure that you have someone that\u2019s reading the fine print for you.\u201d\n\nView the University of Maryland/Washington Post Poll:\nTrend doc\nCross tabs",

    "summary": "A majority of Americans support high school athletes earning money through endorsement deals, with the highest support among Black and Hispanic respondents. However, there is less support for youth athletes before high school to profit from endorsements.",
    "content": "Since a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2021 that opened the door for college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, debate about athlete endorsements has dominated college sports.\u00a0\nCollege athletes aren\u2019t the only ones to profit since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in NCAA v. Alston. High school athletes also are scoring deals, a development supported by a small majority of Americans.\u00a0\nThe Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the university\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and the Washington Post, conducted a national poll of 1,584 adults. The online poll from August 17-23 probed attitudes about high school athletes and athletes before high school profiting from endorsements.\n\nThe poll found that 54% of respondents believe that high school athletes should be allowed to earn money through endorsement deals. Only 40% of respondents believe that youth athletes before high school should earn money from endorsing products or services.\n\nBlack respondents were more likely to favor high school and youth athletes profiting from endorsements; 73% of Black respondents supported high school athletes earning money from endorsements; 60% were in favor of youth athletes profiting from them.\n\nHispanic Americans also overwhelmingly favored high school athletes profiting from NIL deals. Seventy-four percent of Hispanic participants approved of high school athletes being paid for endorsements. A small majority of 56% supported youth athletes making endorsements.\n\nThough NIL deals are more common among college players, several\u00a0 top earners signed their first deals as high school students. Top basketball recruits Bronny James and Juju Watkins were seniors at Sierra Canyon High School last year when they signed with Nike. Seven athletes on On3.com\u2019s top 100 NIL valuation list are high school students.\nJoshua Horowitz, a real estate broker from Long Beach, New York, has seen both college and high school students endorse products or services. He believes that all athletes, including high school and youth athletes, should be compensated for endorsement deals.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re endorsing a product, you should be reimbursed. It\u2019s not free, right?\u201d Horowitz said.\nSara Turnure, a barista from New Jersey, has never seen an athlete, college or high school-aged, endorse a product or service. She supports high school athletes making endorsement deals but not youth athletes, who she believes shouldn\u2019t be making endorsement deals at all.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re\u2026old enough to make a decision like that when they\u2019re that young,\u201d Turnure said.\nThe percentage of respondents who approve of young athletes signing endorsement deals decreased among older groups. Just 36% of respondents over 65 favor high school athletes signing endorsement deals compared to 73% for those between 18 and 29.\u00a0\n\nAmong Democrats, 62% supported endorsement deals for high school players compared to only 41% for Republicans.\u00a0\n\nThe poll also found differences in responses based on geography. Sixty-three percent of Americans in Urban areas are in favor of high school athletes earning endorsement money, which is more than 10 percent greater than the percentage of participants in rural and suburban areas.\u00a0\nRespondents who live in the Northeast were also more supportive of NIL in high school sports than other regions. The Midwest was the least supportive region, with less than half of Americans in favor.\n\nView the University of Maryland/Washington Post Poll:\nTrend doc\nCross tabs",

Riverdale Baptist School and Bishop McNamara High School, both located in Prince George\u2019s County, sent seven players each to Division I programs.\n\nBishop McNamara girl\u2019s basketball head coach Ronald James is entering his first season as head coach of the program. He is familiar with some of the players on his team since he coached them on TeamTakeover, a Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) team based in Washington, D.C., that competes against other 17-and-under Amature Athletic Union (AAU) teams in the area.\nJames said many of his players will be on Division I rosters in the coming years and described a pipeline between Bishop McNamara and Division I women\u2019s basketball.\n\u201cWe have two seniors on the team, the other is probably going to go to a mid-major Division I school or possibly a Power 5,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a boatload of juniors that are on varsity, they\u2019re slated to go Division I and a freshman who I would consider one of the top-10 persons in the country.\u201d\nOne of his players at Bishop McNamara, senior Madisen McDaniel, has been playing for James at various levels since she was in fourth grade, he said. McDaniel is committed to playing for the University of South Carolina.\nAnother Bishop McNamara alumna, Jakia Brown-Turner, transferred to the University of Maryland as a graduate student from NC State.\nThis season, there are 114 Division I players from Maryland, down from last season\u2019s 133.\nMarylanders are represented in different collegiate conferences\nThere were 24 Marylanders at Power 5 schools in 2022-23.

    "summary": "Laurel Park is set to host the Maryland Million amid recent safety concerns and implemented recommendations following a temporary shutdown due to horse deaths. Despite these measures, the sport continues to face criticism over its safety record, with multiple high-profile incidents both locally and nationally.",
    "content": "LAUREL, Md \u2013 As Laurel Park readies to host the Jim McKay Maryland Million Day on Saturday, track officials say they are confident in the facility\u2019s safety, just over five months after racing was temporarily suspended after two horses died in back-to-back races on April 20.\nIn the shadow of that event, Laurel Park closed for eight days while a safety inspection was conducted by John Passero, a longtime track superintendent for the Maryland Jockey Club, which runs races in the state. After his examination, and consultation between the club, the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association, and the Maryland Horse Breeders Association, Passero gave the track a clean bill of health, implementing safety recommendations for future races.\nPassero advised that surface changes made by rainfall be monitored and suggested alterations to the park\u2019s methods for harrowing, or plowing, the track before races, among other precautions.\nSeveral protocols, most of which were already requirements of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, will be strictly enforced for this year\u2019s Maryland Million race, including thorough pre-race veterinary examinations, medication requirements and training requirements, said Alan Foreman, general counsel to the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association who was recently appointed ombudsman to HISA.\nBut the safety measures may not be enough to quiet criticism of the sport, which has seen numerous, high-profile horse deaths, including in May when a horse was euthanized after a race just before Maryland\u2019s famed Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.\nLaurel Park marked six horse deaths in the month of April, including the two on-field fractures that led to the shutdown, and 14 to date at the facility in 2023, according to data gathered by Horseracing Wrongs, a nonprofit aimed at ending the horse racing industry in the U.S.\u00a0\nSeventeen horses died at Saratoga Race Course in New York this summer, while 12 horses died this Spring at Churchill Downs in the weeks surrounding the Kentucky Derby. A report published by HISA last month concluded no relationship between the death of the horses and the condition of the Kentucky racetrack.\nAccording to Horseracing Wrongs, there is an average of 35 horse deaths at Maryland tracks each year. There were 33 confirmed deaths in 2021, 26 in 2022, and 15 so far this year.\nLeaders in Maryland\u2019s horse racing industry say they are studying the problems and working hard to correct any problems.\n\u201cAnytime there\u2019s a breakdown (the industry term for a horse unable to run), it needs to be examined to determine what the cause or causes were on each breakdown, whether they could have been prevented or whether they were just bad luck or an accident,\u201d said Foreman.\u00a0\nCricket Goodall, executive director of Maryland Million Limited, which hosts this event each year, said the Jockey Club is looking into new technology to mitigate risks of catastrophic injury, including StrideSafe, a cell phone-sized device worn by a horse that can detect irregularities in its stride at high speed. This could identify any pre-existing conditions or internal injuries not visible to the jockey before they cause career-ending injuries.\u00a0\n\u201cI believe the incidents of breakdown (in Maryland) are the lowest ever in the history of racing, but one breakdown is too many,\u201d said Goodall. \u201cIt\u2019s on social media, on television so more people are aware, but the incidents have actually been reduced.\u201d\nThose measures are enough for Damon Dilodovico, who has been involved in the horse racing industry for nearly 30 years. It was a horse he trained, Bigmancan, that was the second confirmed horse death at Laurel Park on April 20. That incident has not shaken his faith in the industry, and he plans to enter one of his thoroughbreds, Patriotic Party, in Saturday\u2019s race.\nI think it\u2019s important to support (the industry) these days and enjoy the horses,\u201d said Dilodovico. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not going to be one of the favorites, I think it\u2019s important that you take part.\u201d\nThe Million is the third-largest race in the state, behind the Preakness Stakes and its precursor, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. It attracts owners from around the state to enter their thoroughbreds for a chance to win a percentage of the $1 million in purses.\nEllie Victorina, ridden by Grant Whitacre, leads the pack in the second race of the day on Oct. 1 at Laurel Park. (Angel Gingras/Capital News Service)\nThe race generates anywhere from $4 million to $6 million in revenue each year, with most of the funds going back to bettors, then to the industry and the state to run more races.\u00a0\nBut, the cluster of horse deaths at Laurel Park this year isn\u2019t any different than any other year. In fact, things are improving at Laurel Park.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOur record has been outstanding since the corrections were made to Laurel,\u201d said Foreman. \u201cIn general, the incidence of catastrophic breakdown in Maryland has been declining substantially for the last five years.\u201d\nYet, there are those who believe that the industry will never be safe enough.\u00a0\nJennifer Sully, the Maryland representative for Horseracing Wrongs, said horses are injured because they are racing too young.\u00a0\n\u201cTheir bodies are nowhere near mature. These horses are trained when they\u2019re 18 months old. They\u2019re raced when they\u2019re 2 years old, and a 2-year-old horse is equal to a human kindergartner,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u00a0\nMaryland Million Day will feature 12 races this year, with two races reserved for 2-year-old horses and two reserved for 3-year-old horses. The rest are for all horses ages three and up.\u00a0\n\u201cA lot of people want to say it\u2019s the trainer or it\u2019s the track surface or it\u2019s all these other anomalies that just have nothing to do with why they\u2019re dying, and it\u2019s just sort of an answer to feed the public,\u201d said Sully. \u201cBut the bottom line is they\u2019re way too young.\u201d\nDilodovico shares the concern about racing young horses.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you push them too hard, you know, maybe they\u2019ll develop issues or fail altogether and you end up having to send them home to the farm to let them mature,\u201d said Dilodovico.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep horses racing into the later years, and I think that\u2019s in part because we don\u2019t push them too hard to race early,\u201d\u00a0\nWith all the attention on horse deaths, said Foreman, it\u2019s been a \u201cdifficult year.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal is to get to zero (track deaths). It\u2019s going to be difficult to get to zero, but you do everything you can to prevent it from happening and try to learn from the situation when it does happen, which is what we do. We\u2019re laser focused on it.\u201d\nThe only real solution, Sully says, is putting an end to the industry.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no gray area or reform or happy medium. Horse racing just needs to end. The killing is built into the industry itself and these horses will keep dying as long as horse racing exists,\u201d said Sully.\nHISA will publish a full report on the investigation into the safety at Laurel Park in the coming months. The 38th Maryland Million will run Saturday with the first race starting at 11:30 a.m.",

The head coach for the Caps affiliate team the Hershey Bears ran the practice, aiming to get players ready for the next level.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s go time,\u201d said Todd Nelson on Saturday. \u201cWe just want to make sure that they\u2019re ready, so today\u2019s practice was a pretty intense practice for the first day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHolding the practice at McMullen Arena gives players a chance to get away from the Capitals facility and experience a new environment, according to Capitals Assistant General Manager Ross Mahoney.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a good facility and so close by,\u201d said Mahoney. \u201cIt was kind of in the works for about a year trying to get it worked out and be able to make this work.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nA handful of fans attended, buzzing with excitement over which rookies they might see suit up for the Capitals this year. The players took pictures with the fans and signed autographs briefly after each practice.\n\u00a0\nCapitals 2023 second-round pick Andrew Cristall signs autographs for fans after rookie camp Sunday Sept. 17, 2023. (Capital News Service/Tommy Tucker)\nCamp consisted of fast-paced passing and breakaway drills, working on player\u2019s speed, footwork, passing and shooting abilities. The goalies warmed up before practice and were in the net blocking shots for all the drills.\u00a0\nAmong the 21 prospects and invitees attending the camp were Hendrix Lapierre and Vincent Iorio, both being part of the Hershey Bears Calder Cup Championship team.\u00a0\nThe Capitals drafted Lapierre 22nd overall in the 2020 NHL Draft, despite lingering injuries during his draft-eligible year. In the years following, Lapierre received limited playing experience due to shortened seasons as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Hershey, Lapierre found consistency and became part of a deep playoff championship run.\n\u201cI think winning itself is a form of experience \u2013 like you don\u2019t realize it, but just going through the motions, the ups and downs, like when you lose a game and play the game after,\u201d said Lapierre at MedStar Capitals Iceplex Saturday.\nLapierre showed off his skating ability in many drills, outpacing many teammates and hitting his shots in stride.\nAfter trading away their 2021 first-round pick for Anthony Mantha, Vincent Iorio was the first player drafted by the Capitals in 2021, taken 55th overall. Iorio made the jump to the professional level in the 2022-23 season, playing 63 regular season games with the Bears and three at the NHL level with the Capitals.\u00a0\n\u201cThat experience of winning, It\u2019s different watching them, as far as the way they carry themselves, I think it\u2019s more confident,\u201d said Mahoney after camp on Sunday.\nIorio seemed calm and composed while defending during drills, using his agility to keep his opponent in front of him. He showed some frustration with his shot placement during the second day of the camp.\u00a0\nAnother of the more professionally experienced prospects attending was Ivan Miroshnichenko. The Capitals drafted Miroshnichenko 20th overall in the 2022 NHL draft, a few months after his diagnosis with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma. Miroshnichenko would finish his treatment and be cleared to play part way through the 2022-23 season, appearing in 23 games at the highest Russian professional level.\u00a0\n\u201cHe can really shoot the puck, and he\u2019s physical,\u201d said Mahoney. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good character and leadership, too.\u201d\nMiroshnichenko briefly took slap shots from the left faceoff circle \u2013 known as the \u201coffice\u201d of Caps\u2019 star player Alexander Ovechkin \u2013 after practice on Sunday. Miroshnichenko emulated the Capitals captain, firing shots that startled the fans behind the glass when he missed.\u00a0\nOther notable prospects there were Alexander Suzdalev and Andrew Cristall.\u00a0\nDrafted in the third round of the 2022 draft, Suzdalev played the entire season with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League alongside 2023 first-overall pick Connor Bedard. Suzdalev may make the jump from the junior level to Hershey in the coming season.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to improve every day and listen to the coaches, take advice, and just focus on the next step,\u201d said Suzdalev. \u201cIf the chance comes and if I get some games I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be ready and do my best.\u201d\nThe Capitals selected Cristall 40th overall in the 2023 NHL draft from the Kelowna Rockets in the WHL. Like Suzdalev, Cristall is familiar with Chicago Blackhawks 2023 overall No. 1 pick Connor Bedard, having played together at a young age. He scored 95 points in 54 games at the junior level last season, showing a high-level scoring ability, with skating speed his biggest weakness.\u00a0\nCristall demonstrated his stickhandling skills at camp, effortlessly weaving the puck around and between his opponent\u2019s legs.\u00a0\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nSince the draft, Cristall has made improvements in his skating ability but still has room to grow, according to Mahoney.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s, you know, showing that it\u2019s improved a little bit, but you know, still a lot of work to go,\u201d said Cristall. \u201cI definitely feel you know, step faster for sure.\u201d\nFour goaltenders attended the camp, with Mitchell Gibson and Clay Stevenson having the most experience.\u00a0\nDrafted in 2018\u2019s fourth round, Gibson played three seasons with Harvard University, recording a .919 save percentage in the 2022-23 season.\u00a0\nStevenson made the jump to the professional level after signing with the Capitals following his 2021-22 season with Dartmouth College. He played 36 games with the Caps\u2019 affiliate South Carolina Stingrays, recording a .916 save percentage.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always patient with those guys and most of them end up starting in South Carolina,\u201d said Mahoney about the goalies.\nThe camp concludes today, before the start of training camp, and the first preseason game on Sunday, Sept. 24.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2013 The National Hockey League Washington Capitals will hold their 2023 Rookie Camp at McMullen Arena on the Naval Academy Campus in Annapolis Sunday through Tuesday.\nIt\u2019s the first time the team has been in the city since the 2018 Stadium Series game played at the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. Previously the Capitals practiced at McMullen Arena in 2014.\n\u201cWhat a great thing for local families and Caps fans,\u201d said Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley, through a spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s a treat to be able to bring the kids to free practices here in our own backyard, especially as the team works their way back toward bringing home a second Stanley Cup.\u201d\nHeading into the 2023-24 season with a new head coach, Spencer Carbery, the Capitals look to determine which rookies could join the roster ahead of training camp and the start of preseason on the 24th.\nThe average age for Capitals players during the 2022-23 season was 29 years old, making them the fourth-oldest team in the league, according to Elite Prospects, an ice hockey statistical database.\nOn Monday, Carbery went on a podcast with Mike Vogel, a Capitals senior editor and content strategist, discussing his expectations for younger players within the organization and their potential role in the upcoming season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical in the salary cap era having that relief from entry-level players being able to come into your lineup and play, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll emphasize,\u201d said Carbery. \u201cThey know that there\u2019s a level of play that they have to live up to and we\u2019re gonna help them get there and they\u2019re gonna have plenty of opportunity.\u201d\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u00a0\nDue to the pandemic, the NHL salary cap stayed the same from 2020 to 2022, compared to 6% and 2.52% increases in 2018 and 2019, according to CapFriendly, a hockey business website. Salary cap stagnation gives teams less room to work with for roster decisions, making younger players on entry-level contracts crucial for cap flexibility.\nAttending the camp are 15 Capitals-affiliated draft picks and prospects, along with six invitees from various levels of play. Among the invited players is Ryan Leibold, an Ashburn, Virginia, native who played for the Washington Little Capitals under-18 team in 2015.\nNotable Capitals draft picks attending include former first-round picks Ivan Miroshnichenko and Hendrix Lapierre, second-round picks Vincent Iorio and Andrew Cristall, along with 2022 third-round pick Alexander Suzdalev.\nMiroshnichenko, Lapierre and Iorio are among the more experienced prospects. Lapierre appeared in six NHL games during the 2021-22 season, and Iorio played in three games in the previous season. Both played in the Hershey Bears Calder Cup run last season. Miroshnichenko played in the Kontinental Hockey League last season, the Russian professional league.\nThe camp begins Saturday at MedStar Capitals Iceplex in Arlington, Va., before moving to Annapolis for the remainder of the camp. Practices at McMullen Arena start at 9 a.m. and will be open to the public and free of charge.",

The team name, chosen from five finalists including Battle Swans and Diezel Dogs, will be announced on July 20.",
    "content": "HAGERSTOWN \u2014 From the corner of West Baltimore Street and Summit Avenue, you can see the future of baseball in the Hub City\nThere aren\u2019t any home runs flying yet. But next Spring, the cranes and construction workers will be gone. The 6.25-acre site in Downtown Hagerstown will be changed into a ballpark with a capacity for about 3,000 fans. It will be a ballpark that reflects the history and traditions of this hard-working city of 43,000 people, according to planners.\n\u201cOur goal is to make sure that the design ties into the community,\u201d said Jonathan O\u2019Neil Cole, the ballpark\u2019s architect and a founding principal of Pendulum Studio, a Kansas City architectural firm.\nProfessional baseball is part of Hagerstown\u2019s DNA. Pro teams have played in the city for more than 100 years with only brief gaps The latest gap began September 2, 2019, when the Hagerstown Suns played their last game at historic and outdated Municipal Stadium.\nIn April or May 2024 \u2013 depending on when the ballpark is finished \u2013 baseball returns. An expansion franchise in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball is expected to move to the new ballpark and become the 11th team in the Atlantic League. Hagerstown\u2019s team will have local and regional rivals. Other Atlantic League franchises are located in Frederick and Waldorf , Maryland and in Lancaster and York, Pennsylvania.\nFor now, there are some important unknowns about the team. Its name is scheduled to be announced July 20, according to Downtown Baseball LLC, which owns the franchise. Downtown Baseball conducted a team-naming contest and received more than 1,700 entries from fans. The finalists: Battle Swans, Diezel Dogs, Flying Boxcars, Haymakers and Tin Lizards.\nCamdyn Bernard, Gabrielle Fuller and Kelsey Harris show posters displaying possible names for Hagerstown\u2019s new baseball team. (Mark Hyman/The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nDetails of the ballpark\u2019s design also haven\u2019t been revealed to the public. In May, the Maryland Stadium Authority released early renderings showing the grandstand, picnic areas, bullpens, walking paths and a batter\u2019s eye. The Stadium Authority is overseeing the project for the Maryland General Assembly which approved funding of $70 million for the project in 2021.\nOne thing is clear from interviews with those planning the ballpark. The final design will reflect Hagerstown history. The city was a hub for railroad transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries leading to the name Hub City. It also was a center for manufacturing of bricks.\n\u201cWe know the city has a long history in brick masonry. That\u2019s one of the important pieces of the design,\u201d said Cole, the architect.\nThe location in downtown also is significant to the design. A landmark running along the ballpark is a \u201cCultural Trail,\u201d a half-mile walkway. The trail connects Hagerstown attractions including the downtown Arts & Entertainment District, City Park and the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts.\n\u201cThere are opportunities to take advantage of the pedestrian experience. It\u2019s an urban ballpark,\u201d Cole said.\nCole has been involved in the design of 29 minor league ballparks. For him, the importance of capturing Hagerstown\u2019s essence and history is at the forefront.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in cookie cutter design,\u201d Cole said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just take a ballpark from somewhere else and drop it off. We want to respond to the context of the cities that they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just take a ballpark from somewhere else and drop it off. We want to respond to the context of the cities that they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\u2014Jonathan O\u2019Neil Cole, architect of the new Hagerstown ballpark\n\nPart of that mission is to design a ballpark that will be used for many purposes besides playing baseball games. That is a feature of some of the most iconic ballparks. In Baltimore, fans can stroll down Eutaw Street to have a look inside Camden Yards, the city\u2019s famous baseball ballpark, on days when the Orioles aren\u2019t playing.\nJanet Marie Smith, who worked for the Orioles and contributed to the design of Camden Yards, said one of the challenges in any urban ballpark is \u201chow do we use what we built for baseball for other things?; how do we build other things that the community might want into this model?\u201d\nHistory also can help create an emotional bond, said Smith, Senior Vice President, Planning and Development for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so many places where baseball has intersected with our American history. It\u2019s fun when buildings are able to tell their own stories, even if they\u2019re new buildings,\u201d she said.\n\nA major emphasis of independent baseball league stadiums is on fan experience and accessibility. The number of fixed seats has moved from 5,000 to closer to 3,500-4,000 to provide flexible seating for non-sporting events.\n\u201cIf we want to have a concert there, it would probably be better to have some more moveable seats because that way it\u2019s a different fan experience compared to a baseball game,\u201d said Greg Snook, the President and CEO of the Hagerstown-Washington County Industrial Foundation, Inc.\nAlong with the many seating options, the stadium will have eight private suites, measuring 15-by-20 feet, each with 12 seats overlooking the field, according to Chuck Domino, a consultant for the team\u2019s ownership group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being over-built for the market size that it\u2019s in,\u201d Domino said.\nThe ballpark will feature multiple \u201cneighborhoods\u201d throughout the concourse, with a beer garden in right-center field, a bar in the leftfield corner and a picnic area behind the leftfield wall.\nAccording to Domino, these areas will be key for non-baseball fans.\n\u201cBaseball fans are great and you need them as your core, but we really want to build the stadium to attract casual fans who may not watch any of the game,\u201d he said.\nThough the ballpark is expected to draw mostly from Washington and surrounding counties, there also will be fans supporting the team from beyond Maryland and learning about Hagerstown\u2019s history from its design.\nJames Stiles, a longtime resident of Hagerstown, made \u201cmemories for a lifetime\u201d at the old Municipal Stadium. Now, from his home in North Dakota, he is following the new team on social media. He said he and his family are planning a reunion at the ballpark. He might even buy a season ticket just to show support.\n\u201cOur boys grew up there,\u201d Stiles said, speaking about minor-league baseball games. \u201cThat we still care and are supportive says much for the significance of baseball in Hagerstown.\u201d\nA model of Hagerstown\u2019s old Municipal Stadium sits on display at the Washington County Historical Society.

    "summary": "Hagerstown, a town with a rich Little League history, saw its passion for baseball decline after the disbandment of its professional team in 2020 and a significant drop in youth league participation. Reintroducing a professional team could revive interest and foster new community connections, similar to the positive impact the former Hagerstown Suns had on local youth baseball.",
    "content": "HAGERSTOWN \u2014 Hagerstown has an argument for calling itself one of the premier Little League towns in America. It sent teams to the Little League World Series in 1950, 1968, and 2008, each one bringing together the small Western Maryland town and fostering excitement in the community.\nThat passion for baseball has dwindled in the nearly two decades since 2008. Hagerstown\u2019s professional team disbanded in 2020 and Little League participation plummeted as the number of leagues dropped significantly.\nThe city enjoyed vibrant youth baseball for over a century. Reintroducing a professional team could be key to reviving it, and Little Leagues might help the incoming Atlantic League team create and sustain valuable connections with the community.\n\u201cThe people that attend [the new team\u2019s] games are going to be these kids in these baseball leagues,\u201d Little League coach Sam Croteau said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to see these players and it will give them motivation to work hard and get to that level. Anytime you have \u2026 people to look up to, it\u2019s a huge benefit.\u201d\nThe Suns \u2014 Hagerstown\u2019s former minor league club affiliated with the Orioles and Nationals among other franchises \u2014 and its roster were intertwined with baseball at all levels throughout its existence.\nIt sent players to Little League opening day ceremonies, hosted meet and greets and autograph sessions at local restaurants and parks. The team\u2019s broadcasters sometimes called Little League games on local radio, said Dan Spedden, president of the Hagerstown-Washington County Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\u201cThey would even interview the kids after the game, kind of like you see in a major league game,\u201d Spedden said.\nBut when new ownership took control of the Suns in 2010, those initiatives slowed to an eventual halt. And with it, interest in the team diminished. When Major League baseball contracted the minor leagues in 2020 Hagerstown was one of many cities to lose professional baseball.\n\u201cThe owner was strangling this franchise to death,\u201d said Scott Nicewarner, city administrator and former Suns radio broadcaster. \u201cThe fan base declined. It was absolutely no surprise to us that when the contraction came, we didn\u2019t have a ball team\u2026 It was embarrassing to an extent.\u201d\n\nThat coincided with decreasing Little League participation. Hagerstown, with a population of just over 43,000, was previously home to 13 leagues. It currently has three.\nNationwide trends show a similar fall. Baseball participation in U.S. children 6 years old and up has decreased every year since 2018, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) . Little League has seen a one to two-percent decrease in participation annually since the early 2000s, said Patrick Wilson , Little League Chief Operating Officer.\nThis trend has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of children heavily involved in the sport declined 10.4 percent from 2019 to 2021, the largest decrease in a two-year span since the SFIA began tracking.\nHagerstown\u2019s Little League history is rich. National Little League, one of the city\u2019s leagues, was the third chartered league in Maryland and the first not on an army base. Established in 1949, it earned a trip to the Little League World Series in just its second year of existence.\n\n\u201cEvery Sunday, people would go to church, have lunch and then head out to the ballpark.\u201d\n\u2014Bob Savitt, Hagerstown baseball historian\n\n\u201cBaseball was the big thing,\u201d local baseball historian Bob Savitt said. \u201cEvery Sunday, people would go to church, have lunch and then head out to the ballpark.\u201d\nHagerstown\u2019s National Little League sent a team to the 1950 Little League World Series in its second year of existence. (Little League Baseball and Softball)\nThat baseball culture has weakened in recent decades though. The growing popularity of other sports and the increasing cost of playing baseball have taken a toll on Little League participation both nationally and in Hagerstown, resident Larry Horchner said.\n\u201cBaseball doesn\u2019t seem to be as prevalent in everyday life as it was when I was a kid,\u201d said Mike Conroy, Federal Little League board member.\nFederal Little League, another Hagerstown league, has found ways to reverse that trend. It is the city\u2019s only league that has grown in participation in the past two decades due to the family-friendly atmosphere it fosters.\n\u201cMy dad played Little League baseball, I played Little League baseball, my dad coached me, and now I\u2019ve had the opportunity to coach both my sons,\u201d said Mike Foster, a Federal Little League coach. \u201cThat community spirit of just playing with friends, building friendships, and growing as a person and an athlete [is what Little League baseball is all about].\u201d\nBut the new pro team that will call Hagerstown home in 2024 hopes to help reverse the declining youth baseball trends.\nThe team in the Atlantic League, a league with a partnership but no direct affiliation to MLB, plans to feature Hagerstown\u2019s Little Leagues prominently in its early years of operation, said Chuck Domino , a former minor-league executive who is working with the club as a consultant on ballpark operations. Little Leagues will play games in the ballpark and the team is discussing events like parades featuring players in and around the stadium, Domino said.\n\u201cYou get the kids involved and then they\u2019re gonna show up for the ballgame,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cThen they\u2019re coming 10 years later and they\u2019re drinking beer with their buddies watching the ballgame.\u201d\nA successful reciprocal relationship will stand to help both the team and youth baseball. Promotions will attract little leaguers, who will then benefit from having players to look up to in their own city.\n\u201cMore kids would probably still be playing,\u201d former Herald-Mail sports reporter Bob Parasiliti said. \u201cA kid meets somebody and they find an idol. A lot of these kids didn\u2019t get to meet these guys that were coming to town.\u201d\nHagerstown\u2019s Federal Little League sent a team to the 2008 Little League World Series, becoming the first team to reach the national tournament in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 40 years. (Little League Baseball and Softball)\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since the city last celebrated a local team that reached the Little League World Series. Since then, organized baseball in Hagerstown has witnessed a significant decline in participation. A rekindled interest in baseball could trickle down to the youth level, restoring the city\u2019s rich Little League history while also helping grow the professional club.\nDavid Blenckstone , the father of a player on the 2008 Little League World Series squad and GM of the incoming professional team, witnessed firsthand what a spirited youth baseball culture can do for a city. He hasn\u2019t seen it since. He hopes a successful partnership will help it return.\n\u201cThere was just so much excitement in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was just a lot of pride in this community.\u201d",

But they are Hagerstown people, and history has shown that local ownership can lead to sustained success for a minor league ball club.\nHoward \u201cBlackie\u201d Bowen, James \u201cJim\u201d Holzapfel and Don Bowman \u2014 the three primary investors in the team \u2014 didn\u2019t jump at the idea of owning a baseball team. They did, however, adore the idea of improving Hagerstown and revitalizing the downtown area through a ballpark.\nThe group\u2019s long history in Hagerstown, substantial wealth and political connections propelled them to finally bring baseball back to Hagerstown.\nThe owners scaled one mountain in securing a stadium and team in Hagerstown, but another challenge awaits: keeping the minor league team in a small city that breathes baseball.\n\u201cThe Bowen family, the Holzapfel family, the Bowman family are sort of deeply rooted here. And I think because of that, our families are committed to making sure baseball does not leave Hagerstown,\u201d Holzapfel said.\n\n\u201cOur families are committed to making sure baseball does not leave Hagerstown.\u201d\n\u2014Jim Holzapfel, Hagerstown baseball team owner\n\nThe average life expectancy of an Atlantic League team \u2014 the league the Hagerstown team is joining \u2014 since its inception in 1998 is less than 10 years. Just four of the 10 teams currently in the league have been active for more than a decade. The longest-tenured teams have one thing in common: local owners who care about the community.\nThe York Revolution, founded in 2007, are one of the teams still thriving thanks to a committed local ownership group. In the spring of 2022, the ownership group expanded, adding 12 new investors who have connections to the York community.\n\u201cA business like the Revolution depends on its connection to the community,\u201d majority owner Bill Shipley told the York Dispatch at the time.\n\nBowen has pledged to take a similar approach. He already has formed a team of longtime residents, but he says he, along with the other owners, have agreed to part with some of the ownership in the future.\n\u201cWe plan to sell some of our shares to locals,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe want this to always be here in Hagerstown.\u201d\nBut local ownership isn\u2019t always enough. The investment of the ownership group, quality of the ballpark, fan support and safety of the community all play roles in determining success. Camden, New Jersey, was a city that failed to generate enough support for the Camden Riversharks and shut their doors in 2015 after 14 years. Initially, over 4,000 fans filled the stands every home game at Campbell\u2019s Field in Camden. But that number dwindled as the years went on in large part due to safety concerns in the surrounding area.\nChuck Domino, the president of Domino Management and Consulting LLC, a minor league consulting firm that has assisted with Atlantic League teams, said Camden had a beautiful facility, but that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cPeople just were afraid to go there,\u201d Domino said. \u201cIt was such a dangerous neighborhood that the stadium couldn\u2019t overcome the neighborhood they were in.\u201d\nWhile there are concerns about the homelessness and crime in downtown Hagerstown, it is not comparable to the substantial crime rate in Camden, which led to a decline in attendance.\nIn 2015, the year the Camden Riversharks shut down, Camden County reported 1,520 violent crimes. In 2015, Hagerstown reported 240 violent crimes. The median household income for Camden in 2021 was $30,247, while it was $42,965 in Hagerstown.\n\u201cThere are two things at the top of the list as to why teams are successful,\u201d Domino said. \u201cOne is the facility, two is the management of the team. You can overcome a bad facility or a mediocre facility with great management, but a mediocre facility can not overcome bad management.\u201d\n(Bridget Byrne/The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nThe brand new $70 million dollar facility and the surrounding neighborhood is one step to the revival of baseball in Hagerstown. The ownership group is composed of proven business people. For the town\u2019s sake, hopefully that means great management, too.\nHagerstown has an expansive baseball history, but Bowen isn\u2019t familiar with it. He is, however, familiar with the town in the western part of Maryland with a population of 43,000.\n\u201cI have loved Hagerstown,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s got its challenges as all places do, but I have really enjoyed it.\u201d\nThe four owners\u2019 paths have crossed for decades both in and out of Hagerstown. In the latter stages of their lives, all four are coming together to embark on a different journey.\nBowen, 72, moved to Hagerstown at 7 years old when his dad was transferred for work. He has made a life there since, only leaving for Philadelphia for a few years to attend Villanova University. Bowen met his wife of 50 years at St. Maria Goretti Catholic High School in Hagerstown. Bowen is the chairman and CEO of Ewing Oil, a petroleum distributor that serves various Mid-Atlantic states.\nJim Holzapfel, one of the owners of the new Hagerstown baseball team, surveys the stadium construction site. (Bridget Byrne/The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nHolzapfel is the managing director of the Holzapfel Group at Morgan Stanley, a financial advisory group. He, too, has lived just about his entire life in Hagerstown. Bowen and Holzapfel met as teenagers in Hagerstown, despite Holzapfel being two years older. When Bowen was still a student at Villanova, Holzapfel, a University of Maryland graduate, was starting his first job in Philadelphia and needed a place to live. He called Bowen, who happened to have an extra room.\nFor the next couple years, the two young adults from Hagerstown lived together on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Just a few years later in the mid-1970s, both Bowen and Holzapfel moved back to Hagerstown. As the two remained close friends and grew their respective businesses, they met another local luminary. Bowman was a well-known successful businessman in town who had a trucking company and was considered a mainstay in the community. The three became friends as their businesses grew.\n\u201cThe friendship and, you know, collegiality is deep rooted,\u201d Holzapfel said.\nBowen was named Person of the Year in 2018 by the Herald-Mail, the local newspaper in Hagerstown, for making a \u201cpositive contribution to the community.\u201d Bowman was awarded the honor the year prior.\nBowman\u2019s philanthropic efforts are present in various aspects of the downtown community including the $40 million project to renovate and expand the Maryland Theatre that both Bowman and Bowen were involved in. Bowman was the single largest donor with his donation of at least $1 million.\n\u201cDon and the Bowman family have already done so much for downtown, and all of it is successful,\u201d Jessica Green, the executive director of The Maryland Theatre said.\n\u201cNobody has done more for downtown Hagerstown than Don Bowman,\u201d Holzapfel said. \u201cHe\u2019s made a tremendous investment in trying to revitalize the town.\u201d\nTo the owners, revitalizing the downtown area means more foot traffic and activities where people are eager to check out the area, which will push away some of the homelessness and crime.\nThe rebuilding of The Maryland Theatre was the first snowflake to fall.\n\u201cI think that that group of business leaders, obviously highly respected in the community, are really looking at the stadium as the next phase of the snowball. The snowball is getting larger,\u201d Green said.\n\u201cBlackie handpicked Don Bowman and Jim Holzapfel to be partners in this endeavor because of their passion for the community,\u201d Frank Boulton, the fourth partner who has no ties to Hagerstown but brings experience as the founder of the Atlantic League, said.\nBoulton and Bowen met as freshmen at Villanova in 1969 and have been best friends ever since. The two came together despite different personalities \u2013 and priorities.\nBoulton took a keen interest in sports, while Bowen was more studious. That didn\u2019t stop the two from clicking and becoming lifelong friends.\n\u201cI\u2019d be watching a basketball game and he\u2019d tell me we have a finance test tomorrow,\u201d Boulton said.\n\u201cWe do?\u201d Boulton recalled responding.\n\u201cI think he helped me become a better student,\u201d Boulton says decades later.\nBoulton came on as a minority owner to help assist with baseball operations, given his baseball acumen and the other three owners\u2019 inexperience in the sport. Boulton tried to convince the other owners to put the ballpark off a highway where there was already a large chunk of land.\nIt would be easier, cheaper and more convenient. Bowen acknowledged that, but that wasn\u2019t the point.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t do anything for the city of Hagerstown,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe want to go through the hardships necessary to make it go downtown and start to stimulate traffic and foot traffic and have all kinds of positive things.\u201d\nBowen was Boulton\u2019s best man at his wedding decades ago and the two continue to travel the world together, including visits to Italy and France alongside their spouses.\nHagerstown hasn\u2019t had a baseball team since 2020, when many minor league teams were cut as the pandemic hit. Even before that, the Hagerstown Suns were struggling to gain traction playing in a worn down ballpark.\n\u201cWe realized that we would probably never have professional baseball back in Hagerstown if we didn\u2019t get a new stadium,\u201d Holzapfel said.\n\nBowen made some requests to his friends in government. He called Maryland state Sen. Paul Corderman, and then Gov. Larry Hogan, both of whom he served on prior committees with. Both were on board, but securing the necessary funding through the legislature was, according to Bowen, a long shot.\nFirst, Bowen needed to make sure his team would have a league to play in.\nBowen called Boulton, who founded the Atlantic League in 1998 and is the primary owner of the Long Island Ducks, and asked him a simple question.\n\u201cFrank, I need a baseball team,\u201d Bowen told him. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to pay $3 million to join the Atlantic League,\u201d Boulton responded.\n\u201cWhat else do I need to do,\u201d Bowen said.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Boulton quipped. \u201cYou were the best man at my wedding, I\u2019m not gonna give you a baseball team when you want one?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a baseball team. What do I have to do?\u201d\n\u2014Blackie Bowen, Hagerstown baseball team owner\n\nEventually, Bowen leveraged his connections with Hogan, Corderman and Thomas Kelso, who was appointed by Hogan as chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, into receiving approval for the funds necessary to build a stadium in downtown Hagerstown.\nThere\u2019s the saying that everyone knows everyone in a small town. But in Hagerstown, everyone knows Bowen. As a lifer, Bowen\u2019s imprint on the community is almost as big as the land that was bought to build the ballpark. Bowen is involved in various organizations and charities in the community, and is constantly interacting with business owners and residents. He hopes, and expects, that will help draw crowds to the stadium.\nDieter Blosel, who owns a popular German restaurant called Schmankerl Stube in downtown Hagerstown, recalls Bowen treating everyone with respect and carrying a genuine curiosity for people\u2019s roles in the community.\n\u201cHe sees people how they are,\u201d Blosel says. \u201cIf he sees that you are a person who tried to do something for the community and to just be a hardworking and honest person, I think that is all what Blackie wants.\u201d\nBowen is a major contributor to The Maryland Theatre and The Arc of Washington County, a center that serves people with developmental disabilities. Bowen shows up to events and even offers suggestions to the people in charge.\nHe also contributes to his alma mater, St. Maria Goretti Catholic High School, a local Catholic high school his granddaughter attends.\n\u201cHe\u2019s unassuming and anybody can talk to him,\u201d Joseph Padasak, the president of St. Maria Goretti said of Bowen. \u201cHe\u2019s a common man that enjoys being local and doing what he can to help people, and he not only says it, he means it and he does it.\u201d\nThe ballpark is expected to open in April or May 2024, but for Bowen, Holzapfel and Bowman, the games have begun. The ownership group rarely strikes out in their respective endeavors, but time will tell whether this club is a success.",

    "summary": "Frank Boulton, founder of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, has partnered with Howard \u201cBlackie\u201d Bowen and others to bring a new independent league baseball team to Hagerstown, filling a gap since the city lost its previous team in 2021. Boulton's involvement is crucial as he brings extensive experience in managing minor league teams, having owned stakes in several over the past three decades.",
    "content": "In 1986, Frank Boulton received a phone call from a close friend with an intriguing offer: a chance to acquire a 25% stake in a minor league baseball team.\nThe asking price for the stake was $50,000. The friend was Howard \u201cBlackie\u201d Bowen, his former college roommate at Villanova University and the best man at Boulton\u2019s wedding. The team was in Hagerstown.\nBowen told Boulton that the owners of the Hagerstown Suns were looking for partners. At the time, Bowen didn\u2019t want to participate but he thought that Boulton would be interested.\nBoulton passed on the offer, which in those days seemed too pricey. But after discussing the deal with Bowen \u201cI kind of got the bug and I started looking into minor league baseball and what was going on,\u201d said Boulton.\nNow, 37 years later, Boulton is a major player in America\u2019s independent baseball leagues. He recently partnered with Bowen and others to create a new independent league baseball team for Hagerstown, which lost its old team in 2021. The new team, which doesn\u2019t yet have a name, will be the latest in a long line of teams that Boulton has partly or wholly owned (he declined to give an exact number) since 1990 when he paid $500,000 to acquire a 50% stake in the Prince William Cannons, an affiliate of the New York Yankees.\n\u201cThose of us on the Hagerstown side wouldn\u2019t be involved if Frank weren\u2019t involved because none of us know anything about running a baseball team,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re delighted to have Frank there.\u201d\nWhile Boulton isn\u2019t well known in Maryland, he\u2019s influential on his home turf of Long Island, New York, where he wears a lot of caps. He\u2019s the founder and chief executive of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent league that is trying to expand the number of minor league teams in mid-size towns across the U.S.\n\n\u201cThose of us on the Hagerstown side wouldn\u2019t be involved if Frank weren\u2019t involved because none of us know anything about running a baseball team.\u201d\n\u2014Blackie Bowen, Hagerstown baseball team owner\n\nHe\u2019s in his 23rd year as the owner of the Long Island Ducks, which have won four Atlantic League championships. Previously, in addition to the Cannons, Boulton owned the Albany-Colonie Yankees, another affiliate of the New York Yankees, and the Peninsula Pilots, which became the Wilmington Blue Rocks, an affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. He sold all three teams before forming the Atlantic League.\nBoulton\u2019s Atlantic League entered into a partnership with Major League Baseball a few years ago to help create new baseball rules and try out equipment and facilities by testing them out first at minor league ballparks. The Atlantic League is essentially \u201ca Petri dish for experimental rules,\u201d he said.\nFor example, new MLB rules that came into place this season, including a pitch timer, limits on defensive shifts and bigger bases, were first tested in the Atlantic League.\u00a0 A few weeks ago, MLB announced that it was extending its partnership with the Atlantic League to experiment with other potential changes, including testing the designated pinch runner rule that will allow a designated pinch runner to substitute at any point during the game as a baserunner. On its website, the MLB said the possible change is intended to inject more speed into the sport.\nBoulton grew up and still lives in Brightwaters, New York,\u00a0 a small town that faces the Great South Bay on Long Island, about 49 miles from Manhattan. After graduating from Villanova, he worked for 23 years as a bond trader on Wall Street, eventually becoming the senior managing director of the government bond department at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, which is now part of Morgan Stanley.\nBoulton said he formed the Atlantic League after the New York Mets blocked his attempt to move the Albany-Colonie team from Albany to Long Island. In the New York metro area, most of the city and the northern suburbs were considered Yankee territory while Long Island and Staten Island were considered Mets territory. Boulton said he was told that he could not operate a Yankees affiliate in Mets\u2019 territory.\nThe MLB is exempt from antitrust laws, which critics argue allows their team owners to thwart competition. Independent league teams, however, are protected by antitrust laws and are able to construct new stadiums and operate almost anywhere.\nBoulton said another reason for creating the Atlantic was to provide employment opportunities for players who aren\u2019t able to play in the major leagues due to injuries, skill level, fatigue or other reasons.\n\u201cI wanted to create a boutique league that played at the top of the food chain with guys that were the best 200 players in the world that weren\u2019t signed to a major league contract,\u201d Boulton said.\n\nSome players make repeated trips between the major and minor leagues. Consider Michael Tonkin, currently a pitcher for MLB\u2019s Atlanta Braves. After a long career with the Minnesota Twins and its affiliates, he was released in 2017 and played for several minor league teams, landing on the Long Island Ducks team in June 2019. Two months later, his contract was sold to MLB\u2019s Arizona Diamondbacks. Two years after that, he returned to the Ducks, where he stayed for four months before joining Toros de Tijuana in the Mexican League. He signed with Atlanta in January 2022.\nDespite the opportunities that the Atlantic League has given to players, Boulton said that his main goal is \u201cto be part of an organization that provides affordable family entertainment to that community.\u201d",

A comprehensive database project at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism now allows users to explore detailed individual player statistics, highlighting top performances like Duke\u2019s Dyson Williams, who scored 54 goals with only 4 assists.",
    "content": "The 2023 NCAA lacrosse season represented a marked shift from 2022. All four of last season\u2019s Final Four teams are already eliminated from competition and there has been unusual parity across the country.\nWith only eight teams remaining, it is possible to start recapping the year that was in Division 1 Men\u2019s Lacrosse, in particular the individual performances.\nAs part of a semester long project at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, I have worked to create a database to aggregate NCAA lacrosse statistics. The idea for the project was simple. NCAA statistics are kept fairly well on a school by school basis, but it is very difficult to find aggregated statistics. The solution was to give users the ability to compare every player in the nation, and have the ability to sort and filter. The dataset can be found here.\nFor example, if one wanted to know who the best pure goal scorers were, they could filter to select only players with 10 or fewer assists. Then they could sort it to show who among that list had the most goals (for those curious, this player is Duke\u2019s Dyson Williams, who has 54 goals and 4 assists). There are pretty much infinite possibilities, which is why it is a useful tool for coaches, casual fans, and lacrosse journalists. It gives the reader the power to find whatever obscure statistics they want.\nUsing these filters, it is possible to visualize the best individual performances this year in college lacrosse. Some of the results will be completely unsurprising, while others may point out something new.\n1. Let\u2019s look at the big picture first\u2026\n\nThis scatterplot represents every player in the NCAA with a single dot. The first findings are fairly intuitive. Most NCAA lacrosse players either don\u2019t score at all, or score very little, hence the density in the bottom left corner of the chart. Scatterplots are useful to show outliers and in this example we can see players at the extremes of goals and assists. In the assists category, Tewaarton candidates Pat Kavanagh and Connor Shellenberger are the only two athletes with more than 45 assists. Duke\u2019s Brennan O\u2019Neill (39 Assists) and Johns Hopkins\u2019 Jacob Angelus (42 assists) could get there with a productive playoff run. Kavanagh and Shellenberger posted impressive turnover numbers (or lack thereof) as well, pointing to elite efficiency this season.\nIn the goals category, it is likely that the NCAA will have four or more 60 goal scorers. As of May 17th, CJ Kirst of Cornell (Tewaarton finalist) leads the country with 65 goals. Tucker Dordevic of Georgetown (Tewaarton finalist) is in second with 63, but still has games to play, and both players are followed closely by Yale\u2019s Chris Lyons who will end the year with 62 goals. Xander Dickson currently has 58 goals, and broke the all-time UVA record of 57 this past weekend. Depending on what happens, he could easily break the 60 barrier. Meanwhile, Duke\u2019s Williams needs six to reach 60, a possibility that will depend greatly on Duke\u2019s team success.\nAssuming Dickson scores at least two more, it will be the first time since 2015 that four players have broken the 60 goal barrier. That year, a freshmen Connor Fields scored 66 times, followed by Stony Brook\u2019s Brody Eastwood (62), Brown\u2019s Dylan Molloy (62) and Ryan Brown of Johns Hopkins (61).\nOn a lighter note, this chart also shows some of the more anomalous statistical performances this year. TJ Haley of Georgetown has one goal compared to 24 assists, while Syracuse\u2019s Jackson Birtwistle pitched a perfect season with 27 goals and 0 assists.\n2. It has been a historic goal-scoring year at the top.\u00a0\n\nMany of the takeaways here are intuitive. Namely, in order to score a lot of goals, you need to shoot the ball a lot and shoot efficiently. What is most notable is just how efficient the top scorers are, a feat even more impressive considering how all of these players are the focal points of opposing defenses and their game plans. Unsurprisingly, Lyons, Kirst, and Dordevic lead the nation in shots. However it is worth noting that all of them shoot above 35%. Typically, a successful shooter is anything over roughly 30%, so all three of these athletes have elite efficiency to match their relentless volume.\nThe outlier here is Dickson, who is shooting 57% on his 58 goals. That sort of efficiency is nearly unprecedented in recent memory. Below is a table of all the players who have scored more than 6o goals since 2014, ranked in order of their shooting percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nPlayer\nSchool\nGoals\nShots\nShooting Percentage\n\n\n2015\nBrody Eastwood\nStony Brook\n62\n97\n63.9%\n\n\n2023\nXander Dickson*\nVirginia\n58\n102\n56.9%\n\n\n2019\nMac O\u2019keefe\nPenn State\n78\n148\n52.7%\n\n\n2018\nJustin Guterding\nDuke\n66\n134\n49.3%\n\n\n2021\nJared Bernhardt\nMaryland\n71\n145\n49.0%\n\n\n2022\nLogan Wisnauskas\nMaryland\n61\n125\n48.8%\n\n\n2016\nKylor Bellistri\nBrown\n63\n138\n45.7%\n\n\n2019\nKevin Lindley\nLoyola\n60\n133\n45.1%\n\n\n2019\nDaniel Bucaro\nGeorgetown\n61\n139\n43.9%\n\n\n2022\nThomas McConvey\nVermont\n60\n144\n41.7%\n\n\n2014\nMiles Thompson\nUAlbany\n82\n197\n41.6%\n\n\n2023\nChris Lyons\nYale\n62\n149\n41.6%\n\n\n2014\nJordan Wolf\nDuke\n64\n154\n41.6%\n\n\n2015\nConnor Fields\nUAlbany\n66\n162\n40.7%\n\n\n2016\nDylan Molloy\nBrown\n62\n161\n38.5%\n\n\n2023\nCJ Kirst\nCornell\n65\n177\n36.7%\n\n\n2022\nJohn Piatelli\nCornell\n66\n186\n35.5%\n\n\n2023\nTucker Dordevic*\nGeorgetown\n63\n178\n35.4%\n\n\n2018\nBen Reeves\nYale\n62\n177\n35.0%\n\n\n2015\nDylan Molloy\nBrown\n62\n183\n33.9%\n\n\n2015\nRyan Brown\nJohns Hopkins\n61\n182\n33.5%\n\n\n\n*Still playing the 2023 season.\nAs you can see, Dickson is on a historic pace, amongst a crew of record breaking individuals.\nAs a brief aside, Brody Eastwood scoring 62 goals on less than 100 shots was absolutely remarkable and will go down in history as one of the greatest shooting seasons ever.\n3. Joey Spallina was the best offensive freshman\u2026 and it wasn\u2019t close.\n\nJoey Spallina entered college with high expectations, and he crushed the competition amongst freshmen. He finished the season tied for third in goals and led the assists column by a landslide as well. For goals and assists, there were groups at the very top. These are easy to spot on scatterplots as the data points are geographically close to each other. Spallina, represented here in the top right of the chart, has no other points around him. The future is bright for Syracuse and their #22.\nOne other notable development is that Bryant had the top two freshmen goal scorers: Jack Lonsinger led all rookies and Johnny Hackett was right behind. Keep a strong eye on the Bulldogs in the coming years, led by this lethal duo.\nMeanwhile in the assist column, 2023 Patriot League Rookie of the Year Evan Plunkett (Army), and B1G Freshmen of the Year Braden Erksa (Maryland) had the most productive years outside of Spallina. Both Erksa and Plunkett hail from the state of Georgia, and serve as a testament to the growth of the game in that area in recent years.\n4. Lehigh\u2019s Checo and Albany\u2019s Piseno are names you need to know.\n\nWhile most of the names mentioned above will be known to casual and die-hard lacrosse fans alike, the caused turnover and ground ball numbers bring out some new names. One of the issues with traditional ground ball numbers is that they include face-off athletes who overwhelm defensive players and dilute their contributions. Using the sorting and filtering tools of this site, it was possible to filter for athletes who had taken less than 30 faceoffs (a reasonable barrier for talented midfielders who may have to take them in a pinch but aren\u2019t true FOGO\u2019s).\nThree such players on the defensive side of the ball are Lehigh\u2019s Richard Checo, Albany\u2019s Jake Piseno, and Steven Schmitt of Mount Saint Mary\u2019s. Piseno and Checo are leading the country in caused turnovers (CT\u2019s) by a wide margin. Checo\u2019s 54 CT\u2019s are 16 more than the third place player. In other words, his CT\u2019s come in 42% higher than the third place player.\nCheco, a product of St. Johns College High School in DC, joins a long list of disruptive LSM\u2019s to play for the Mountain Hawks. As just a freshmen this year, he has one of the highest upsides in the entire country.\nSchmitt scooped a remarkable 97 ground balls while taking just 11 faceoffs the entire season. Like Checo, his contribution is so vastly superior to his competitors that it is worth noting.\n5. The best FOGO\u2019s have different styles.\n\nUsing the assumption that faceoff athletes are exclusively competing on faceoff events, so all of their ground balls (or at least a close enough approximation) are face-off wins. Faceoff wins are a box score stat that refers to whichever team picked up the ball, so by dividing the total ground balls by their faceoff wins, it is clear how many of their overall wins they pick up themselves. Hover over the plot points in the second chart above to reveal the Self Win Percentage for each player.\nConsider the differing styles of the top faceoff athletes. Zach Cole of Saint Joseph\u2019s and Mike Sisselberger of Lehigh win nearly identical percentages to each other, roughly 66% or two thirds.\nFor comparison, elite faceoff athletes like Jake Naso of Duke and Luke Weirman of Maryland win it to themselves comparatively less, at 52% and 54% respectively. So there are differences in styles represented in the data as teams get more and more prepared to approach the draw as a team event.\nWhat is clear is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy that all the top teams use. Different faceoff guys have different strengths, and the same is true for their wing players. Appreciating that is helpful to understand the nuances of the position and enjoy the battles every weekend.\nIt is important to remember that all of these statistics are relatively primitive compared to other more advanced sports. The lacrosse analytics revolution in lacrosse but is waiting on better statistics and more data. Until then however, the hope is that databases like the one represented here give the tools to anyone who is interested, to comb through the data we do have. It really is a great way to recognize the incredible athletes who represent this great sport at the highest level.",

    "summary": "The Baltimore Orioles are shifting their player makeup with an increased focus on non-American players in their minor league affiliates, a change driven by new leadership and scouting strategies since 2018. This shift aims to build a robust international talent pipeline from the lowest levels of the minors up to the major league team.",
    "content": "Changes in the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 scouting strategy could change the player make-up of the major league team in coming years. More non-American players are entering the Orioles\u2019 minor league affiliate teams and moving their way toward the majors.\nCapital News Service\u2019s analysis of the Orioles and minor league affiliate teams\u2019 2023 rosters shows that the organization is overwhelmingly made up of American-born players. Only the Orioles lowest-level affiliate \u2014 the low-A Delmarva Shorebirds \u2014 does not have the same American and college-experienced team make-up.\n\n\n\nStaff changes in the Orioles front office and a new scouting strategy led to this sudden uptick in non-American players on Orioles\u2019 affiliate teams.\nUnder former General Manager Dan Duquette, the Orioles didn\u2019t prioritize international scouting. This strategy was due to concerns over limited regulation of the international market and a focus on spending money on the major league team, rather than minor league affiliates, according to Jon Meoli, Orioles columnist for The Baltimore Banner.\nThis changed when Mike Elias took over as general manager in November 2018. According to data analyzed by CNS, the Orioles began to build an international scouting program that led to higher numbers of non-American players in the organization.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build an elite talent pipeline that\u2019s going to extend from the lowest rung of our minor league ladder \u2026 all the way up to triple-A and onto the major league roster here in Baltimore,\u201d Elias said in a November 2018 press conference when he was introduced as the new general manager.\nElias hired Koby Perez as the international scouting director in January 2019 to lead the international program.\n\u201cWe have found the right person to spearhead the Orioles\u2019 new international presence. [Perez\u2019s] experience, connections and reputation built across a fast-rising career in multiple successful organizations will immediately elevate our capabilities in this critical market,\u201d Elias said in a statement released on Twitter when Perez was hired. \u201cWe will continue to augment our operation until the Baltimore Orioles are leaders in recruiting and developing international players.\u201d\nWith this new strategy, the number of players from outside the U.S. on the Delmarva Shorebirds has significantly increased since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Shorebirds were made up of 72% American players in 2019. Just 28% of the team was not American-born, with the largest subgroup being Dominicans at 14%. Other players on the 2019 roster hailed from Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Bermuda and Italy.\nThis year, the Shorebirds are made up of 67% non-American players. Nearly half of the team is from the Dominican Republic while only 33% is American. Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Taiwan are also represented on the team.\n\n\n\nWhile diversity has greatly increased on the Orioles low-A team over the last few years, the higher level affiliate teams are still majority American.\nThe high-A Aberdeen Ironbirds are the second most diverse team in the organization, but are 76% American-born, much higher than the Shorebirds. The double-A Bowie Baysox and triple-A Norfolk Tides are 86% and 85% American, respectively, in line with the Orioles 86% American 40-man roster. (Note: The Orioles\u2019 40-man roster includes several Tides players. These players are included in the statistics for both teams.)\n\n\n\nElias and Perez\u2019s goal to bring international talent to the Orioles is starting to be reflected in the Shorebirds 2023 roster and could appear on the Orioles major league team in coming years. In the meantime, the organization is continuing to dedicate resources to its international scouting program, according to MLB.com.\nIn October 2021, the Orioles broke ground on a new Dominican Academy for players in the Dominican Summer League. The 22.5-acre complex is expected to open this year.\n\u201cInternational scouting and player development are critical to the future success of the Orioles and baseball as a whole,\u201d Elias said at the groundbreaking. \u201cWe have made tremendous strides over the last couple of years in establishing our international presence and revamping our baseball operations infrastructure and this project may be the most momentous step yet.\u201d",

    "summary": "SC Freiburg coach Christian Streich highlighted the intense pressure and high turnover rates among football managers, particularly in Major League Soccer and three of Europe\u2019s top five leagues since 1996. La Liga and Serie A have seen the most coaching changes, with 561 and 551 respectively, while the MLS has had the fewest at 192 since its inception.",
    "content": "When asked about the recent prevalence of coaching changes in Germany, SC Freiburg coach Christian Streich gave an impassioned five-minute long response at a pre-match press conference in April.\nStreich has held his post for more than twice as long as any other current head coach in the league. The most tenured manager in the Bundesliga, Germany\u2019s top football league, expressed at length that the current pressure on coaches and clubs is immense, as it is throughout society as a whole.\n\u201cThe sporting directors are also under enormous pressure,\u201d Streich said. \u201cThe club loses two, three games, and then people lose their minds and spread things on social media, it\u2019s terrible. That wouldn\u2019t have happened in the past.\u201d\nClubs and managers are feeling that stress now more than ever, evidenced by an increase in coaching changes in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States and across three of Europe\u2019s top five leagues since 1996.\nWhile Serie A, Italy\u2019s top league, and La Liga, the premiere Spanish league, have had consistently high turnover rates since the beginning of the century, the MLS, England\u2019s Premier League, France\u2019s Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga have all seen those rates rise \u2014 apart from a drop in coaching changes across all six divisions in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically shifted league schedules.\n\nLa Liga and Serie A had by far the most coaching changes since 1996 due their constant high turnover with 561 and 551 moves, respectively. The Premier League, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 have all had between 323 and 380 changes in that span. The MLS had the least amount of coaching changes of the six leagues, with just 192 since the division\u2019s first season in 1996.\n\nThe latest manager to be sacked in the Premier League embodies the desperation and pressure many clubs and coaches presently face, with Javi Gracia being dismissed on Tuesday after 11 games with Leeds hovering just above the relegation zone.\nGracia lifted Leeds from 19th at the time of his hiring to 17th in the league at the time of his departure. The club opted to replace him after just 67 days in charge to bring in the experienced Sam Allardyce in a bid to avoid relegation. Allardyce will be the fourth manager to oversee a Leeds match this season.\nThe decision to part ways with Gracia also caused sporting director Victor Orta to depart because he opposed the move, according to The Athletic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense period. It hurt me a lot to lose my job, but I have to say [Orta\u2019s] exit is just as difficult for me, if not more,\u201d Gracia told The Athletic.\nThe average head coach\u2019s tenure isn\u2019t as short as Gracia\u2019s abbreviated stint with Leeds. However, each of the six divisions have multiple coaches without much experience at the helm of their current team.\nThe median tenure of coaches in the MLS and across Europe\u2019s top five is less than two years.\nDespite its historically high turnover, a majority of current Serie A coaches were appointed at the beginning of the 2021-22 season or earlier. The MLS held the second longest median tenure of the six leagues with its lack of general coaching turnover.\nThe average managers in the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Premier League were all appointed at the beginning of the current season or later, with median tenures of 307 days, 304 days and 207 days, respectively.\n\nThe European leagues that showed a rise in manager changes over time \u2014 the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and the Premier League \u2014 now hold the three lowest median coaching tenures of the six divisions.\nWith little time to lay a foundation, many coaches are now expected to get results from the day they\u2019re hired or be shown the door.\n\u201cI only entered because another coach lost his job, but now I have left and another manager replaces me,\u201d Gracia told The Athletic. \u201cI do think to be able to do a good job, greater stability is needed. It is more healthy and you are able to show your best work.\u201d\n\n\nA glance at some of the shortest managerial exploits in the U.S. and England\nThe quest to stay competitive or remain in a division means soccer clubs sometimes have to quickly acknowledge their poor decisions.\nManagerial lifespans are already shrinking in the MLS and across some of Europe\u2019s top five leagues. Taking a deeper dive uncovers some of the briefest and most reckless managerial appointments of the 21st century in England and the United States.\n\nLes Reed\nLes Reed was promoted from his position as assistant coach to the first head coaching role of his career at England\u2019s Charlton Athletic in 2006.\nReed was relieved of his duties more than a month after he was hired, boasting just a single victory in eight matches. His 0.5 points per game mark is the joint-second worst of former Premier League managers since 1996.\nReed earned the nicknames \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and \u201cSanta Clueless\u201d by the end of his reign and has yet to take another head coaching job in the 17 years since.\n\u201cWould I change what happened at Charlton? No,\u201d Reed told The Athletic in 2021. \u201cCharlton is still my club \u2026 I dived into something because I thought I was doing the right thing for the club in the worst circumstances.\u201d\nFrank de Boer\nFrank de Boer signed a three-year contract with England\u2019s Crystal Palace after a troublesome spell at Inter Milan.\nDe Boer coached only 14 games during his short term in Italy before he was fired in November. His time in England went even worse as he managed only five matches, the lowest number of matches of any non-interim or caretaker manager in the Premier League since 1996. \nCrystal Palace lost its first four Premier League games of the season without scoring a goal, and the only win of de Boer\u2019s tenure was a 2-1 victory over lower-league side Ipswich Town.\nDe Boer served a short stint as Atlanta United\u2019s head coach before he took charge of the Dutch national team in 2020. The Netherlands topped their group of the European Championship in 2021 but lost in the opening round of the knockout stages. De Boer was let go after the tournament and has not held a head coaching role since.\n\nChris Armas\nAfter six-year head coach Greg Vanney stepped away from Toronto FC, the Canadian club turned to Chris Armas to fill his role.\nArmas earned only 0.6 points per game, the second-worst mark in league history, during his 15 games as Toronto\u2019s manager and suffered a humiliating 7-1 loss to D.C. United in his last game in charge. \nArmas went on to become an assistant manager at Manchester United and Leeds over the last two years. Armas drew criticism during his time in the first role, with ESPN reporting that Manchester United players likened him to Ted Lasso, the fictional coach.\nThomas Rongen\nThe inaugural head coach of Chivas USA didn\u2019t fare much better than the franchise did over the next decade.\nThomas Rongen recorded just one win in the franchise\u2019s first 10 games before getting the ax, recording 0.4 points per match \u2014 the worst mark of any non-interim or caretaker manager in MLS history.\nRongen\u2019s successor, Hans Westerhof, didn\u2019t do better. He ended up with the third-worst managerial spell in the league\u2019s history to cap off Chivas USA\u2019s tumultuous inaugural season.\nRongen\u2019s future would end up being more intriguing than Chivas USA\u2019s, a club that was dissolved at the end of the 2014 season without a trophy.\nThe Dutch coach would become manager of American Samoa, a team that was the focus of the 2014 British documentary \u201cNext Goal Wins.\u201d",

    "content": "UCLA women\u2019s gymnastics is used to change.\nThe Bruins have had three head coaches over the past five seasons and now face an impending conference switch. UCLA will join the Big Ten in August 2024, meaning its gymnastics team will take on a new slate of conference opponents during the 2025 season.\nThe move signals a shift from competing against Pac-12 rivals like Utah and California, some of the best teams in the country, to a conference with one national champion in the 40 years of NCAA gymnastics championships.\nUCLA head coach Janelle McDonald said she welcomes the chance to consistently compete against new teams. \n\u201cOur student athletes are going to continue to get really great opportunities on and off the gymnastics floor,\u201d she said. \nThe Bruins have won the third-most NCAA titles of all schools at seven, with their most recent victory coming in 2018. The Big Ten\u2019s only national championship came more recently than UCLA\u2019s triumph, with Michigan claiming the conference\u2019s first NCAA title in 2021. \nUCLA isn\u2019t the only historically successful gymnastics program with an upcoming conference switch. Oklahoma becomes a member of the SEC next year and will begin to face foes like Florida and LSU in 2025. The Sooners have won six national titles, adding a second consecutive trophy last month.\n\nMaryland head coach Brett Nelligan said UCLA\u2019s move brings additional strength to the conference, including the buzz that surrounds competing against a top team.\n\u201cIt means we\u2019re able to go against the best of the best every weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just adds more excitement for our student athletes and for our fans.\u201d\nIn terms of season-high scores, UCLA has almost always outperformed Big Ten teams over the past decade. \nIn six seasons since 2014, the Bruins boasted a higher season-best score than any Big Ten school. Michigan was the only team to outscore them more than once over that span. \n\u201cMy philosophy has always been that you\u2019re only as good as the teams you compete against,\u201d Michigan head coach Bev Plocki said.\n\nSeason-average scores tell a similar story.\nUCLA\u2019s season average has placed toward the top of the Big Ten over the past 10 years. \nMichigan began overtaking the Bruins\u2019 scores starting in the 2021 season. Even though their season highs and averages have exceeded UCLA\u2019s since then, the Wolverines have yet to make another national final since their victory. \n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s harder to repeat than it is to get there that first time,\u201d Plocki said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the agony of defeat, you don\u2019t have the fire in your belly to go back and fight harder.\u201d\nThe Bruins missed out on the past three consecutive NCAA finals. Longtime head coach Valorie Kondos Field left in 2019 and was replaced by Chris Waller from 2020 to 2022, whose brief reign was marred by controversy. McDonald is in her first year with the program.\nThe Bruins overcame the tumultuous stretch and returned to the NCAA semifinals for the first time since 2019 last month, receiving the highest non-advancing score in an NCAA semifinal competition. \nUCLA\u2019s third-place finish to Oklahoma and Utah meant they missed out on the collegiate final for just the seventh time since 1993, but its strong performance in the latter stages of the national tournament meant a lot to the program, McDonald said.\n\u201cCulturally, our team is in a really great place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe needed to learn to love gymnastics again \u2026 The team kept leaning in and moving forward together.\u201d\n\nUCLA will contend with the adjustments that come with switching conferences.\nGymnastics is a subjective sport, with scores varying between different regions. UCLA\u2019s results could change when the Bruins face new judges.\n\u201cFor whatever reason, the scores tend to fluctuate,\u201d Nelligan said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the true outcome till they\u2019re head-to-head within the conference.\u201d \nUCLA is geographically isolated compared to the rest of the Big Ten. The conference shift could mean farther travel for athletes. \nBut gymnastics is unique in that multiple teams can perform simultaneously in a meet. Four or five schools can rotate through events at the same time. \nWhile exact details aren\u2019t finalized, there have been initial meetings about scheduling. \n\u201cThe travel was actually going to be less than we had anticipated because the Big Ten is so committed to making this a smooth transition and limiting the impact on our student athletes overall,\u201d McDonald said.",

    "summary": "New MLB rules, including a pitch clock, larger bases, and shift restrictions, have shortened games by an average of 20 minutes and led to more stolen bases in the 2023 season. The pitch clock, which penalizes pitchers and batters for delays, has been effective in reducing game length, bringing it down to an average of two hours and thirty-eight minutes.",
    "content": "The 2023 MLB season started out with a bang, as the Boston Red Sox faced the Baltimore Orioles. Sox third baseman Rafael Devers became the first player to strike out due to a pitch clock violation. As the clock fell below eight seconds, Devers was still not set in the batters box. An automatic strike was called, bringing the game to an end. A pitch clock, larger bases, and shift restrictions are the new normal for Major League Baseball, after being tested at the minor league level last year. \n The new pitch clock gives pitchers fifteen seconds with no players on base, and 20 seconds with players on base, to begin their pitching motion.  If they have not started their motion before the clock runs out, the batter will receive an automatic ball, according to the MLB website. The timer will reset if the pitcher attempts to pick off a player on base. \nThis rule affects batters as well; they must  be within the batting box by the eight second mark of the clock or receive an automatic strike. There were 33 clock violations in the first 35 games of the MLB season, according to the New York Times.  \n\nMost pitchers have a pitch tempo of under twenty seconds with players on the base, as shown in the chart above. Many pitchers, however, struggle to deliver their pitches in under fifteen seconds with no runners on the base. Sixty percent of MLB teams have an average pitch tempo of over fifteen seconds with no runners on base, based on the data from baseball savant, a statistical website designed to show baseball stats in an easy to view way.\nThe main purpose of the pitch clock is to shorten the length of games, which have notoriously been over three hours long. After the implementation of this pitch clock in the minor leagues, games were shortened by twenty five minutes. So far in the major leagues, games have been shortened by an average of twenty minutes. \n\nIn 2023, the major league average game time is two hours and thirty eight minutes thus far. The last time a game was this short was in 1984, according to data collected by Baseball Reference, a source for baseball history. The length of games increased to over three hours beginning in 2012, and hasn\u2019t fallen below that mark until this year.  \n\tThe MLB also increased the size of bases from fifteen to eighteen square inches. They did this as a way to reduce collisions when players are attempting to steal a base. This rule, along with the pitch clock, has assisted in increasing the number of stolen bases in the game. It has also decreased the size between bases by four and a half inches. Home plate is the only base that has remained the same size, according to the official MLB website.\n\tThe Baltimore Orioles stole the most bases on opening day in their win against the Boston Red Sox, headlined by two stolen bases by Cedric Mullins. They stole five bases with five chances, starting the trend that many other teams have since begun to follow. The Orioles are the only team, however, that stole ten bases across two games in their opening weekend match up. \nThere were 124 stolen bases within the first week of the season, compared to 61 in the first week of the 2022 season, and this new success rate can likely be attributed to the new rules of the game. \n\nAt the minor league level, stolen bases skyrocketed in 2022 after base size was increased, with a 25% increase in stolen bases, according to Bleacher Nation. The number of players who stole 50+ bases in the 2022 season tripled, going from six in 2021 to 18 in 2022. \nShift restrictions have also been introduced this season. A minimum of four players must be on the infield, with one on either side of second base. Before this rule, players could adjust their positioning based on the tendencies of the batter, but new rules keep them in specific positions until the pitch is thrown. If the infielders are not in their correct positions when the play begins, the offensive team can decide on an automatic ball, or accept the result of the play at hand. This rule was put in place to increase the batting average on balls in play, and to allow players on the field to showcase their skills, according to the MLB website. \n Fivethirtyeight created a metric for viewing how MLB teams stand as a result of the new rules put in play; MANFRED (Metric for Assessing Negative or Favorable Rule-Effect Dynamics). MANFRED takes into account pitch tempos, shift restrictions, and stolen bases from previous seasons, and projects a ranking for MLB teams based on how they performed across these categories. Many teams that were ranked poorly by Fivethirtyeight when using their Elo ratings, which looks at margin of victory and quality of their opponent, are ranked much higher on the MANFRED scale, which focuses solely on the new rules.",

    "summary": "Maryland's women\u2019s basketball team saw its highest average regular season attendance in over a decade this year, yet it still lags behind the men\u2019s team, which attracted nearly double the audience. Despite improvements, the disparity highlights ongoing inequalities in collegiate sports viewership and support.",
    "content": "Men\u2019s collegiate basketball has been a dominant force in the United States for over 75 years, bringing the nation together every March for one of the biggest sporting spectacles of the year. And while the women\u2019s game has continually improved and gained ground over the years, the gap in viewership and attendance, particularly in the regular season, is still sizable.\u00a0\nEven at the University of Maryland, home to the fourth most winningest women\u2019s program in the country in the last eight years, there is still a visible disparity.\u00a0\nThe Terps women\u2019s team had an average regular season attendance of 7,379 this season, their highest average since the 2009 season. Yet the men\u2019s team, who won about 18 percent less of their games than the women, garnered an average attendance of 14,046, nearly double the women\u2019s average.\u00a0\nThis gap in attendance may seem large, but it is actually the smallest gap in the last 10 years. Last season, the women\u2019s average attendance made up only 39 percent of the men\u2019s average attendance, and two years before that the women\u2019s attendance averages made up just under 37 percent of the men\u2019s.\n\nPercentage of Seats Occupied at Home Games Per Regular Season\nFor the past 10 years, UMD\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team has consistently attracted a crowd that fills up over 70% of seats at XFINITY Center on average, while women reached 41% in 2023, the highest it\u2019s been in that period.\nClick on a season to see the attendance rates for each team.\n\n\n\nNote: Graphic does not represent actual seats filled. It is a visual representation of attendance rates per season. Source: National Collegiate Athletic Association\n\nAlthough men\u2019s teams tend to have higher attendance numbers in general due to the prominence of the game, having a women\u2019s team garner more attendance isn\u2019t impossible. At the University of South Carolina, the women\u2019s leader in average attendance every year since 2015, the women have had a higher average regular season attendance number than the men in six of the last eight seasons.\u00a0\nThe women at South Carolina have been a dominant force in womens basketball for the past decade whereas the men have won less than 60 percent of their regular season games in 10 of the last 13 seasons. And while the argument can be made that they receive attendance because of the success of their team, a team\u2019s win rate does not necessarily correlate with attendance.\nIn the past 10 years, the Maryland women\u2019s team has had a higher regular season win percentage than the men in every season but have only managed to get over half of the men\u2019s attendance numbers once in that time, in 2023.\u00a0\nThe last time the Maryland men won more regular season games than the women was in 2010, when Greivis V\u00e1squez headlined the team and was drafted to the Memphis Grizzlies shortly after.\n\n\nThe women at Maryland have been consistent in wins and flooded with talent for the last decade at least, and it shows on a national level. Since 1997, 22 players from the women\u2019s basketball team at the University of Maryland have been drafted to the WNBA, including Diamond Miller and Abby Meyers in this week\u2019s draft, who were selected second and eleventh overall respectively.\u00a0\nYet Maryland women lag behind in pulling crowds to home games. Some believe this is due to different advertising techniques for the teams or just a lack of focus on women\u2019s athletics in general.\n\u201cWell I think that, just in general when I hear about the sports here, the women aren\u2019t even talked about,\u201d said Junior Maxima Pacheco. \u201cSo just because of that, I\u2019m just more prone to going to the men\u2019s games in general.\u201d\nThe Instagram account for the Maryland Terrapins athletics (@marylandterrapins) uploaded a total of 136 posts about basketball from November 7th to March 3rd, the duration of the 2023 regular season. Over this time period, there were 85 posts about the men\u2019s basketball team, and just 38 posts about the women\u2019s. The remaining 13 were posts that were about the men and women combined.\nAnd while the women received more shine in March, with 59% of posts featuring women\u2019s sports, 36% men\u2019s sports with 5% representing both men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports, according to UMD women\u2019s basketball marketing and social media staff, they also ventured two rounds deeper into the tournament than the men, meaning their postseason lasted longer.\nIndividually, the men\u2019s Instagram account (@terrapinhoops) has 81.7k followers as of April 2023. The women\u2019s account, (@terpswbb), has just 30.8k.\nThe discrepancies in attendance and popularity is not for a lack of trying, according to Rose DiPaula, Director of Strategic Communications for WBB at the University of Maryland. The women\u2019s basketball team\u2019s marketing and social media departments have made an avid effort to increase attendance and popularity.\nThroughout the 2023 season, the team had seven games scheduled where students could redeem a giveaway item. The team participated in seven on-campus promotions, such as Stamp Takeovers and Dining Hall Promotions, aimed to reach students and campus staff. On top of that, the marketing staff traveled to four road games and met with other teams\u2019 marketing staff to help gather ideas.\u00a0\n\u201cCould we always do more marketing or advertising? Of course. That\u2019s a never ending thing,\u201d said DiPaula. \u201cI think we\u2019re always looking for new ideas. We feel like we\u2019re doing a lot but we\u2019re always looking for more and we\u2019re open to new ideas.\u201d\nSouth Carolina has seen success in illustrating a similar interaction from the women\u2019s team to their fanbase, otherwise known as FAMs, according to Monique Brown, Assistant Director of Marketing at the University of South Carolina.\n\u201cOn social media we have done videos to get to know players and staff/their personalities,\u201d said Brown in an email. \u201cAfter games, the team and Coach walk around and interact with FAMS as well as on social media which allows them to build relationships as well. Everyone does a great job of being interactive and understanding the value of public support for the program by being appreciative of everything offered to them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne factor that could\u2019ve led to the spike in the attendance for the Maryland women this year was their tough non-conference schedule, one that unlike the conference schedule, the team gets to hand select.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we certainly hoped that we\u2019d have great attendance this year. I think one factor is we knew we had a great home opponent slate,\u201d said DiPaula. \u201cWe knew with bringing in South Carolina, Uconn, obviously in the non-conference, which is something we have control over, that certainly helps when you\u2019re bringing in good opponents, fans certainly enjoy that.\u201d\u00a0\nTiming of games also may play a role in attendance. The men\u2019s games tend to occur at night and frequently are flooded with Maryland students whereas women\u2019s games are often during the day and are made up of many families and non-students.\u00a0\n\u201cI think having a great fanbase is always good for us,\u201d said sophomore guard Shyanne Sellers. \u201cI think we play a lot better when we have a lot of fans behind us and it just makes it tough for our opponents to play well so it\u2019s just always a good experience for us.\u201d\nDespite the gap in attendance between the mens and womens teams, the awareness for women\u2019s basketball is definitely on the rise. This March, the NCAA Women\u2019s National Championship received 9.9 million viewers. That\u2019s more than any Women\u2019s college basketball game ever, any Stanley Cup game since 1973, the 2021 NBA Finals, the 2020 World Series, and all the most recent MLB, NBA and NFL All-Star games, according to Front Office Sports.\nAs women\u2019s programs continue their efforts to minimize the gap in attendance and viewership, the harsh reality is that equaling the men may never be a possibility. However, continually minimizing the gap and growing the popularity of the sport is something programs can strive for.\u00a0\n\u201cThere will be some gap just because of what it is,\u201d said Mel Greenberg, former women\u2019s basketball writer and member of the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cMaybe it gets closer. I don\u2019t want to say never.\u201d",

    "content": "BOULDER, Colo. \u2014 PointsBet, a Denver-based sports betting company that is a corporate sponsor of the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s athletics program, says it is pitching its brand to alums in Colorado and other states where fans are old enough to bet legally.\nBut PointsBet\u2019s association with the university strongly suggests another target: Students.\nUnder its agreement with Buffalo Sports Properties, a company representing CU Boulder, PointsBet\u2019s signs can be displayed at the university\u2019s spring commencement and even at events where teenagers are likely to show up, such as football camps and new student orientation.\nUntil January, the university received a $30 fee when anyone, including a student, signed up at the PointsBet site using a CU promotional code. The university and the sports betting company made a \u201cmutual decision to discontinue that portion of the agreement,\u201d according to a university spokesperson.\nThe largest audience of all for PointsBet may be at CU Boulder football games. At the university\u2019s homecoming contest in October, 40,000 fans showed up to watch their beloved Buffs and message boards that flashed: \u201cPointsBet: Do It Live.\u201d In the crowd were thousands of students, many under age 21, the legal gambling age in Colorado.\nIn Fall 2022 alone, 7,106 first-year students entered CU Boulder.\nRichard Karcher, a law professor who teaches courses on sports and ethics at Eastern Michigan University, noted that PointsBet\u2019s marketing is reaching a young audience regardless of its claims.\n\u201cWho cares whether the university intends for its advertising to reach their students?\u201d Karcher wrote in an email. \u201cIt is, and the university knows it.\u201d\nAs part of a four-month investigation into sports betting on college campuses, The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland obtained the agreement between PointsBet and Buffalo Sports Properties using public records laws.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nThe 16-page agreement specifies where and for which events the company\u2019s signs can be posted.\nPointsBet\u2019s deal with CU Boulder, signed in September 2020, is notable \u2014 it was one of the first to match a university athletics program with a sports betting platform.\nBuffalo Sports Properties\u2019 deal with PointsBet pays the university $1.625 million over five years.\nAt CU, 34% of students are 18 and 19 years old, according to the website College Factual. However, the university prohibits all gambling in university housing.\nB. David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University, said sports betting is pervasive, and \u201cstudents like anybody else are going to do it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s become much more mainstream.\u201d\n\u201cI struggle with anytime there\u2019s predatory marketing, whether it\u2019s cigarettes, alcohol,\u201d Ridpath said. \u201cYou could make the same argument with gambling.\u201d\nPointsBet declined interview requests for this article. In an interview with Sports Business Journal in December 2021, PointsBet\u2019s chief strategy officer, Eric Foote, said the company focuses its marketing on \u201cthe alumni base, the alumni base in Colorado or other states.\u201d\nUnder the agreement at CU Boulder, PointsBet receives wide exposure. Each Buffs football radio broadcast must include a pregame segment featuring the gambling company, a 10-second \u201clive mention\u201d during the game and three 30-second in-game commercials.\n\nAt Folsom Field, CU Boulder\u2019s football stadium, fans see PointsBet messages on various videoboard and LED screens. The public address announcer must make one mention of the company to the crowd.\nThe sponsorship deal also includes CU Boulder\u2019s athletics website \u2014 PointsBet receives banner ads and five \u201chome-page takeovers.\u201d\nAsked about the provision in the PointsBet agreement that permits the company to display signs at new student orientation and other events attended by students, some too young to bet legally in Colorado, a university spokesperson noted that sports-betting signs are \u201caccompanied by corresponding signage with problem-gambling resources and we have a number of safeguards in place to ensure student safety.\u201d\nCollege students are among the most vulnerable to compulsive gambling. Studies from 2007 to 2014 show that 75% to 80% of college students had gambled in the previous year. That was before a 2018 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that has expanded legal sports betting to more than 30 states.\nSponsorships with betting platforms could put students at increased risk, say some addiction experts. \u201cA lot of kids will be exposed to gambling promotion, and it will have the imprimatur of their university,\u201d said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.\nBut CU Boulder alum Janet Borchert said the PointsBet deal was \u201cwonderful,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s really going to help the school.\u201d\nHer only problem with the agreement \u2014 she didn\u2019t know about it sooner.\n\u201cSomebody needs to be telling us this because I would totally be doing it to help the school.

    "content": "On Sept. 10, PointsBet posted a SpongeBob SquarePants meme showing a cartoon character holding a \u201cTo-Do List\u201d of current and former injured football players, including University of Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers. The caption of the Instagram post was simple: \u201cPrayers up for Quinn Ewers\u201d with a praying hands emoji.\nThis meme represents the youthful tone of PointsBet marketing on Instagram. The company maintains a similar tone on TikTok. The approach is typical of sports betting companies on social media. They share content designed to connect with a young audience, according to some social media experts.\nPointsBet joined TikTok in September 2021, creating content on a platform that has dominated the Gen Z market. PointsBet had about 85,100 followers on Instagram and 32,600 followers on TikTok as of Jan. 27. Competitors FanDuel and DraftKings have about 196,000 and 140,000 followers, respectively, on Instagram and about 369,200 and 592,300 followers, respectively, on TikTok.\nThe Pew Research Center found in September 2022 that 52% of TikTok users are 18 to 29, and the popular social media platform created an opportunity for sports betting companies to connect with new users.\nPointsBet\u2019s marketing strategy includes partnerships with colleges and universities. The company has agreements with sports marketing firms that represent the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder. The deals allow it to display signs at the schools\u2019 football and basketball venues.\n\nEric Foote, PointsBet\u2019s chief strategy officer, said in a December 2021 interview with Sports Business Journal that PointsBet directs its marketing campaigns at alums and other fans of these schools\u2019 teams.\n\u201cThe marketing components are focused on the alumni, focused on the season-ticket holders,\u201d Foote said.\nResearchers who study social media, however, note that sports betting companies use a playbook that also allows them to speak to a young audience.\nTexas Tech University sports management professor Jimmy Sanderson said brands like PointsBet are able to reach impressionable college students on social media by embracing a pop-culture marketing strategy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to persuade [college students] to do things because they\u2019re very much invested in following pop-culture trends,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAnd so when these DraftKings and FanDuels of the world kind of attach themselves to those trends, they\u2019re doing that to reach that audience and then cultivate them as a lifelong customer.\u201d\nPointsBet employs brand ambassadors who promote the company on TikTok and Instagram, including former professional golfer Paige Spiranac. These ambassadors rarely talk about the PointsBet product in their posts. Instead, they provide timely commentary about the buzziest topics in sports and betting lines while incorporating the latest top TikTok sounds and hashtags into the videos.\nThe Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland contacted a representative of Spiranac. She did not consent to an interview.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nAndrew Billings, executive director of the University of Alabama Sports Communication program, said brand ambassadors and content choices by PointsBet may reflect a plan to attract young people, specifically young men.\n\u201cThe goal was to make it something that guys do. Guys drive fast cars, guys like violence and guys play fantasy sports. \u2026 You had to make it cool,\u201d Billings said. \u201cNot just appealing but actually cool for people to say, \u2018Oh yes, of course, I need to be in the know on this.\u2019 \u2026 A way to do that is through very appealing spokespeople.\u201d\nDave Kerpen, author of \u201cLikeable Social Media,\u201d a book about how companies use social media to attract customers, said posting content on TikTok does not necessarily suggest a company is targeting a young audience.\n\u201cWhat has worked on social media has changed a lot over the years,\u201d Kerpen said. \u201cIf I were managing a brand today, I would focus on TikTok and Instagram, and I would focus on meme and short-form video content no matter who I was trying to reach.\u201d\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

The high viewership was attributed to engaging elements such as strong quarterback play, a close and high-scoring game, and an exciting finish.",
    "content": "Last Sunday over 100 million people watched as Harrison Butker kicked a go-ahead field goal with 11 seconds left to give the Kansas City Chiefs a 38-35 lead over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57. The kick, a mere 27 yarder, was set up by a controversial defensive holding call on Eagles\u2019 corner James Bradberry on a third down just a minute and a half earlier. \nWhile the penalty and ensuing kick were seen by many as an anticlimactic ending to an extraordinary game, one thing is certain: the Super Bowl is still considered essential television viewing in the United States. \nThe Super Bowl is not only the biggest sports game but also the largest television event of the year in the U.S. This year was no different; the Super Bowl drew over 113 million average viewers on February 12 as the Chiefs defeated the Eagles in a back and forth thriller, according to average U.S. television audience estimates from Nielsen.\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was the second most viewed Super Bowl of all-time behind Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Seattle Seahawks fell to the New England Patriots on a historic last second interception on the goal line, according to television audience estimates from Nielsen. \nThis year\u2019s broadcast broke a recent trend of decreasing viewership, as the Super Bowl had failed to average over 105 million television viewers for five straight years. Before the slump, the big game had averaged over 105 million television viewers for eight straight Super Bowls from 2010-2017. \nSome key factors to high viewership in the Super Bowl tends to be high initial engagement, a good halftime show, high scoring, and a close game or exciting ending to a game, according to SBJ sports viewership writer Austin Karp. This year\u2019s game had, by most accounts, all elements of this formula.\n\u201cStrong quarterback play is important. Nobody wants to watch that Ravens\u2019 2000 defense, nobody wants to watch the Bears\u2019 \u201886 defense nowadays,\u201d Karp said. \u201cPeople want to watch a shootout. They want to see a 38-35 score. That\u2019s why you saw such an incredible number.\u201d\nThe halftime show is proving to be increasingly important to viewership. A good show guarantees some people will tune in to the broadcast regardless of what\u2019s going on in the game.\nThe Super Bowl 57 halftime show, which saw Rhianna make her return to the mainstage, received generally positive reviews. Although the show may not have been as flashy as past years and did not include any surprise guest artists, it still garnered great viewership. \nThis year\u2019s huge viewership success may be a surprise to some, but others almost expected it.\nMike Mulvihill, EVP and Head of Strategy & Analytics at FOX, had predicted a new viewership record at Super Bowl 57, explaining that the markets of Philadelphia and Kansas City, mixed with the host city of Phoenix, could help see totals rise over 115 million, per the Sports Business Journal. And although the viewership didn\u2019t quite meet his expectations, it was fairly close. \nAlthough globally the Super Bowl is not a viewership powerhouse, for example the World Cup final in 2022 saw almost 1.5 billion viewers, it definitely rules all television events in the United States. \nThe Super Bowl takes up 29 of the top 30 most watched television broadcasts in the United States. The only non-Super Bowl to crack the top 30 is the M*A*S*H episode \u201cGoodbye, Farewell and Amen\u201d, which aired in 1983 and saw 106 million Americans tune in. \nThe only programming that delivers even half of the Super Bowl audience numbers is the NFL during the AFC or NFC championship.\nAnother appeal of the Super Bowl is the prominence of high paid advertisements. Over the years Super Bowl advertisements have evolved into a viewing spectacle of their own and have companies spending as much as $7 million in 2023 just for a 30 second time slot. \n\nSome companies may shell out millions buying multiple 30 second commercials. The Super Bowl has almost 50 percent of its viewership from women, meaning companies can target and reach a large and diverse audience. \nThe streaming company Tubi stole the show this year, with a commercial that had viewers cursing their TV and scrambling for their remote. The commercial replicated a return from a commercial break and then \u201cchanged the channel\u201d as one would on a smartTV, causing viewers to go into a panic when in reality it was a 15-second commercial.\nGoogle Trends, which ranks a search term\u2019s popularity from 0-100, 100 being most popular, saw the term \u201cTubi\u201d go from a seven at 7 p.m. on Sunday to a 100 at 10 p.m. the same night. \nThe Super Bowl has only ever been covered by four networks, ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC. The Super Bowl rights are given to one network a year, with Super Bowl 1 being the only exception with both NBC and CBS as broadcasters. \nCBS has broadcast 21 Super Bowls, one more than NBC. FOX only had the rights to ten and did not broadcast a Super Bowl until 1997. ABC has broadcast just seven, and has not had the rights to a Super Bowl broadcast since 2006 when their deal with the NFL ran out. \n\nNext year begins the first year of a new TV contract for the NFL, and the Super Bowl will be broadcast by CBS. Starting next year, the rights to the big game will rotate between CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC, putting ABC back in the mix for the first time since February 2006. CBS, FOX, and NBC will air three Super Bowls in this contract period and ABC will air two. \nWith the success of this year\u2019s broadcast experts believe that, in all likelihood, viewership will only continue to increase.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other way to look at it, the Super Bowl, as a cap on an incredibly successful TV viewership season,\u201d said Karp. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cliche at this point but it\u2019s the only real gathering spot for Americans now. A single gathering spot during the course of a calendar year. I mean, nothing even comes close.\u201d",

    "summary": "Kadarius Toney made history in Super Bowl LVII by recording the longest punt return in Super Bowl history, a 65-yard run that significantly contributed to the Kansas City Chiefs' 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite limited playing time earlier in the game, Toney also caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes, showcasing his impact on both offense and special teams.",
    "content": "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014\u00a0Nobody had ever impacted a Super Bowl via punt return.\nThat was the message Kansas City Chiefs special teams coordinator Dave Toub imprinted upon Kadarius Toney throughout the week leading up to Sunday\u2019s championship game.\nToney\u2019s response? \u201cI ain\u2019t played in it yet.\u201d\nThe implied challenge motivated the young player, who proved Toub\u2019s proclamation false by notching a 65-yard punt return, the longest in Super Bowl history. The return came moments after the wide receiver scored his first postseason touchdown and his third all season.\nThe 24-year-old didn\u2019t start the season in Kansas City, but he contributed to a 14-point surge that helped the Chiefs clinch their second title in four years with a 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.\nToney barely played in the first half, with just one offensive snap. But coach Andy Reid called on him when the Chiefs faced a third down with 12 minutes remaining in the championship game.\u00a0\nA sharp route and nifty play design got the receiver so open \u201cit was kind of surprising,\u201d Toney said. He caught the pass from Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and waltzed in for a 5-yard score.\nSix plays later came the moment that showcased Toney\u2019s talent and answered Toub\u2019s challenge.\nToney stretched for the rapidly falling punt before bringing it to his body. The instant he corralled it, green jerseys surrounded him, all trying to bring him down. Toney wrested himself away from the grip of one Eagles player before stumbling backward.\nHe regained his balance, cutting sideways and reversing the field. He curved further and further upfield, a white-and-red clad horde of Chiefs carving a lane that took him all the way to the 6-yard line. Kansas City scored on that possession to take an eight-point lead.\nWhile Toney had expected the ball from Eagles punter Arryn Siposs to go to his right, instead it led him left.\u00a0\n\u201cI saw a shanked kick,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just making a play \u2026 He kicked the ball where we wanted it.\u201d\nA 2021 first-round pick of the New York Giants, Toney never found a role with that team. A midseason trade brought him to Kansas City and to Reid, who the receiver called the smartest coach in the game.\nToney established himself quickly with the Chiefs, racking up 90 total yards and a touchdown in just his second game.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Giants [were] doing with [Toney], but he\u2019s a dawg,\u201d Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a rubber band, he just jukes so many times.\u201d\nThe appreciation goes both ways.\n\u201cComing here, the environment is just life-changing,\u201d Toney said. \u201cThe energy that you feel in the building day in day out, it\u2019s different. It makes you want to go out there and be the best player you can be.\u201d\nToney did just that Sunday, solidifying a place for himself in record books and as an NFL champion.\nVarun Shankar is a\u00a0junior at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

This decision comes as new media companies like Overtime and the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference are reshaping the landscape of elite high school sports.",
    "content": "In 2021, Rodney Rice was ready to begin his senior year at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland. He was already a star for the powerhouse boys\u2019 basketball team. All signs pointed to Rice having a breakout final season.\nAbout the same time, something radical was happening in youth basketball. A new option for high school players suddenly appeared. A sports media company, Overtime Elite, formed a development program for a few dozen elite players. OTE was doing something unheard of: Paying young players to jump their high school teams and develop their talents as professionals with upstart OTE.\nRice dreamt of playing someday in the National Basketball Association. OTE, with its emphasis on expert coaching and high-level competition, might have been a fast track. It was an opportunity to spend a few seasons in OTE\u2019s program, gaining a high school degree at the same time and get paid for the experience.\nOTE offered to pay Rice a total of $600,000, along with a promise of even more in name, image and likeness deals, Rice\u2019s father told Capital News Service. OTE declined to comment, saying the league does not discuss contract negotiations.\n\u201cThey were talking about how they liked my game, how they can see me playing there, [\u2026] and potentially get drafted in a couple years,\u201d Rice said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound bad at all.\u201d\nShaking up the high school sports hierarchy\nElite high school players like Rice have more options today than ever. Two media companies are shaking up the old order.\nThe National Interscholastic Basketball Conference is a ten-team super conference of private and parochial schools from Florida to Long Island to Utah. All conference games are carried on ESPN cable channels or streamed on ESPN+.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cHigh Stakes Hoops\u201d ]\nOvertime is a fledgling media company that attracts huge audiences to social media posts featuring high school players. It formed OTE to capitalize on that audience.\nIn the end, Rice decided to turn down Overtime Elite and accept an offer to play college basketball at Virginia Tech. He\u2019s now a freshman at the school in Blacksburg, Virginia.\nRice\u2019s decision differs from the choice made by 27 elite high school basketball players who joined Overtime Elite for its first season. One of them was Malik Bowman.\nBowman spent his freshman and sophomore years at Bishop Walsh School, a small Catholic high school in Cumberland, Maryland. His play for the Spartans earned attention from major college programs like the University of Maryland, Georgetown and Ohio State. Bowman opted to skip college, announcing on Twitter in August 2021 that he would be joining OTE\u2019s first-year program.\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking, if I go here, I\u2019m going to be having competition every day to play against,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on top of the pro trainers and coaches who played [professionally], I knew I could learn a lot from them.\u201d\n\nNew beginnings #trulyblessed #humble pic.twitter.com/mVfOeMADuu\n\u2014 malik bowman (@malikbowman10) September 1, 2021\n\nBowman said he was anxious about moving to Atlanta to participate in this new program, but that after his first year, he feels that he made the right choice.\n\u201cI was nervous because, of course, OTE is new. It hasn\u2019t gotten anybody to the [NBA] yet,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I would think that I\u2019m more confident in the decision that I made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was nervous because, of course, OTE is new. It hasn\u2019t gotten anybody to the [NBA] yet.\u201d\n\u2014Malik Bowman, Overtime Elite basketball player\n\nAnother option for today\u2019s elite talent is the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference, the league where 6-foot-6 Travis Roberts competed in his senior season in 2021-22 before joining the Jacksonville State men\u2019s basketball team.\nRoberts did not seek out the NIBC. The league found him when his school, Bishop Walsh, joined the startup league in 2021, putting itself in the company of elite teams across the country. Still, he expressed gratitude for the one year in the league he was able to get.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great playing against a top team in the nation, top players, getting the exposure and you get the best conference in the nation,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for us.\u201d\n\nChoosing the best path\nBasketball runs deep in the Rice family.\nRice\u2019s father, also named Rodney, played high school basketball at St. John\u2019s College High School in DC, earning first team All-Met and Washington Post Player of the Year in 1983. He also played collegiate basketball at Boston College University for one year before finishing off his college career at the University of Richmond. Rice\u2019s grandfather played at Fairmont Heights and was All Met in 1960.\nOTE first reached out to the latest Rice to carry on the basketball legacy through a youth coach who knew the family, Rodney\u2019s father recalled. The elder Rodney works as a player representative, and he managed business affairs for former NBA star Amare Staudomire.\nTalks got serious enough for Rodney\u2019s father to visit OTE\u2019s basketball training headquarters in Atlanta.\nNegotiations extended to October, with OTE putting an offer on the table: $600,000 over two years plus $150,000 in NIL opportunities, according to Rodney\u2019s father.\nThe numbers startled Peter Strickland, Rice\u2019s coach at DeMatha Catholic.\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018My, this world is changing,\u2019\u201d Strickland said. \u201cWe are now pursuing high school players [\u2026] to make them professionals at a really early age.\u201d\nThere were good reasons to say yes to OTE, even beyond the obvious financial incentives. In the new developmental program, Rice would have a chance to learn under head coach Kevin Olllie, a former NBA player and former coach of the University of Connecticut men\u2019s basketball team which won a National Collegiate Athletic Association national championship.\nThe Rice family also was intrigued by the education program offered by OTE. In addition to basketball training, all players attend classes and work toward their high school degrees.\n\u201cBeing able to take classes during the season was a bonus, you could start working towards a degree,\u201d Rice\u2019s father said.\nThere were turnoffs too.\nAt Overtime Elite, Rice would be a professional and would have forfeited any remaining high school and college eligibility. That would have closed an important door for Rice. His one-time high school coach Mike Jones had left Dematha Catholic in 2021 to become associate head coach at Virginia Tech. Coach and player had developed a close relationship. Virginia Tech was one of a few schools that Rice considered, along with Louisville and Alabama.\nIn the end, the decision to say no to OTE and yes to Virginia Tech happened at the family\u2019s breakfast table.\n\nAs Coach Jones would say, #WeUp \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\nGlad this one is a Hokie!\n\u270d\ufe0f @rodneyrice__ #StoneByStone | #Hokies pic.twitter.com/NGPAZyHjJq\n\u2014 Virginia Tech Men\u2019s Basketball (@HokiesMBB) November 10, 2021\n\n\u201cIt was me, Rodney\u2019s mom and himself, and we were kind of going over the pros and cons,\u201d Rodney\u2019s father said.\n\u201cMy dad told me, at the end of the day, I make my own decisions. But I want everyone else to feel comfortable too, especially if it\u2019s my family,\u201d Rice said. Rice\u2019s sister also joined him as a student at Virginia Tech.\n\u201cI made my decision based on my social life, being around people my age and people that don\u2019t play basketball,\u201d Rice said.\nThis basketball season, watch out for Rice in his maroon and orange Hokies uniform. He\u2019ll be wearing No. 1.",

These platforms have significantly boosted the social media presence of teen athletes, with some surpassing even current NBA MVP finalists in follower counts.",
    "content": "To find many of the most recognizable athletes on social media, you have to look past the rosters of the top professional leagues. Instead, look to the high school ranks.\nLeBron \u201cBronny\u201d Raymone James Jr., son of NBA superstar LeBron James, is one of the most followed teen athletes on social media with 6.6 million followers on Instagram. Mikey Williams, a five-star basketball recruit at San Ysidro High School, has 3.7 million followers on Instagram.\nStack that up against Joel Embiid, an NBA MVP finalist. Embiid has 6 million followers on Instagram.\nOvertime and ESPN have played key roles in boosting the celebrity of high school stars. Like few others, these sports media brands have invested in new ventures aimed at developing teen players into tomorrow\u2019s NBA superstars.\nESPN, alongside Paragon Marketing Group, launched the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference in 2021. The NIBC is a super league, with teams made of top-rated high school players. Around the same time, Overtime started Overtime Elite, an ultra-exclusive development program that is professionalizing teen basketball.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cHigh Stakes Hoops\u201d ]\nFor these media companies, the goal is to build profitable brands in youth sports. For the players the goal is to wear an NBA uniform one day.\n\u201cI want to play in the NBA,\u201d said Myles Hosten, who left his family and friends behind in England to play at Bishop Walsh. \u201cThe highest league possible\u2026 Whether it is the NBA or not, just to play pro.\u201d\nThe growth of Overtime Elite\nOvertime Elite was created by the media company Overtime and founders Dan Porter and Zachary Weiner. The duo met at William Morris Agency, where they worked on digital content. In 2016, the duo launched Overtime as a social media haven for elite high school athletes, posting highlight videos on YouTube and on Instagram.\nFormer Duke star Zion Williamson, one of Overtime\u2019s first big stars, went on to become the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. Williamson\u2019s final high school game footage now has 5 million views. This is the 13th most-viewed video of more than 1,400 on Overtime\u2019s YouTube channel. Overtime generates more than 1.5 billion views across social media platforms a month.\nIn October 2021, Porter and Weiner launched Overtime Elite. OTE recruited and signed 27 high school basketball players to contracts worth a minimum of $100,000 per year, splitting them up into three teams.\nThe teams play over 20 games a season, from October to March. Each team has their respective coaches, but all teams are overseen by the director of player development and former University of Connecticut men\u2019s basketball coach Kevin Ollie.\nOTE players have their eyes locked on playing professionally. Joining OTE almost always means losing their amateur status. Currently, all but one player committed to the program is being paid. As salaried athletes, they\u2019re considered pros and no longer are eligible to play college basketball.\nNaasir Cunningham, the top-rated basketball prospect in the class of 2024, agreed to join OTE in April of 2022. He declined a salary in order to maintain his college eligibility. However, Cunningham will have the opportunity to profit from social media deals and other endorsements under new state laws permitting high school athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness.\nOvertime Elite\u2019s basketball hub is located in Atlanta. It consists of three basketball courts, with the main court seating 1,300 and players live on the Overtime campus.\n(Kyle Hess/Overtime Elite)\nTraining methods are sophisticated, with OTE providing players access to experts in analytics, nutrition and fitness. With Ollie, a coach who guided UConn to a national men\u2019s basketball championship in 2014, OTE has one of the most respected teachers in the sport.\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically at a basketball lab and your game should get better,\u201d said Sean Gregory, senior sports correspondent for TIME, who wrote an in-depth article about OTE in November 2021.\nOvertime\u2019s method for bringing OTE to its fans is unique. Games cannot be viewed live but full games are available later, after editing. OTE specializes in highly produced highlights that are posted on social media. That strategy is to build an audience, though it\u2019s smaller than for Overtime\u2019s main channel. In October 2022, OTE\u2019s YouTube channel had more than 52,900 subscribers.\nThe difference in presentation \u2014 highlights for OTE, live game action for NIBC \u2014 represents one of the starkest differences between the competing basketball leagues and their approaches to hooking fans.\nMarc Kohn, chief content officer at OTE, says followers of the league are interested in the backstories of their favorite players. \u201cLook at how the next generation of athletes are important to young people. And young people are interested in following along on their journeys.\u201d\nGhazi, commissioner of NIBC, is just as adamant that fans want to watch full games as they happen. \u201cI still think live is at the essence of what we do\u2026social [media] follows live,\u201d he said.\nIn its first year, OTE has had success gathering sponsors. Gatorade, Meta, State Farm, and Topps all have partnered with the upstart league. Topps, the trading card company, even put out a series featuring all OTE players.\nInvestors, many with connections to sports, entertainment and tech, also are backing Porter\u2019s and Weiner\u2019s bold venture. OTE has already raised about $80 million from a group including hip-hop star Drake, Amazon chairman and founder Jeff Bezos and more than 25 NBA stars including Klay Thompson and Devin Booker.\nThe ascension of NIBC\nThe NIBC is a 10-team league composed of some of the best high school teams and players in the country. Teams are located all over the United States, from Bradenton, Florida, to La Porte, Indiana, from Mount Pleasant City, Utah, to Cumberland, Maryland, a town of roughly 20,000 people.\nUnlike OTE, NIBC does not pay its players, so they all maintain college eligibility. NIBC games can be viewed live, with ESPN networks televising the entire 38-game schedule last season.\n\nSo far, the audience for NIBC games is small. The most-viewed games on ESPNU in 2022 totaled 31,000 views. In comparison, the 2022 NCAA Womens\u2019 National Championship on ESPN drew 4.85 million views and peaked at 5.91 million.\nViewership numbers haven\u2019t discouraged corporate sponsorship of NIBC, though. Last season, the league\u2019s partners included the U.S. Marines, GEICO, Chipotle, and Gatorade.\nBill Carter, a former sports-marketing executive and adjunct professor at the University of Vermont, estimates such agreements pay NIBC from $300,000 to $500,000 per year, with most deals at the lower end.\nFor the brands, it\u2019s about capturing young consumers by aligning with the top teen basketball stars in the country. According to Carter, the message to fans is: \u201cI want you to see that the Oak Hill guys, the Oak Hill players, are drinking Gatorade because that\u2019s what I\u2019m selling.\u201d\n\nThe Oak Hill hooper discuss their favorite kicks wear on and off the court . What do y\u2019all think about their choices ? pic.twitter.com/IYQbBijK3F\n\u2014 NIBC (@NIBCOfficial) November 18, 2022\n\nWhat does the future hold?\nStill, for both NIBC and Overtime Elite, major questions remain.\nWill NIBC be able to grow and attract more fans? Can the league achieve greater parity, instead of being dominated by two or three super schools such as Montverde, IMG or Sunrise Christian?\nFor Overtime Elite, the question becomes: Will the new pay-for-play venture be a successful pathway to the NBA for elite high school players?\nGhazi, creator of NIBC, expressed doubts about OTE\u2019s model.\n\u201cThere are questions, among coaches, if Overtime Elite provides a competitive in-game basketball experience that\u2019s really going to develop players.\u201d Ghazi said.\nOTE officials dismiss those concerns.\n\u201cIf anybody wanted to watch the playoffs and finals and the intensity that went back and forth between our teams\u2026 I\u2019d say that was really, really high end basketball,\u201d Kohn said.\nIt is too early to tell whether NIBC or Overtime Elite is the better option for getting elite high school players to their dream destination, the NBA. However, both companies already are reshaping the landscape of elite high school basketball.",

The rise of elite teams and leagues has raised the stakes for young players. More are dealing with anxiety as they cope with their own goals and the expectations of coaches and parents.\nThe effects of pressure\nGreyson Chappel, a 17-year-old baseball player, faced the pressures of elite sports firsthand.\nThe right-handed pitcher stepped onto the mound at a camp in Missouri in summer 2021. He attempted to fire off his signature fastball, but instead the ball flew toward the dugout. Fear overtook his 6-foot-8, 225-pound frame.\nChappel met with a therapist a few weeks later and soon was diagnosed with performance anxiety.\nApproximately 30 percent of female college athletes and 25 percent of male college athletes suffer from anxiety, yet just 10 percent seek help from a mental health professional, The American College of Sports Medicine said in an August 2021 news release.\nChappel, who plays for De Soto High School in Kansas and the Indiana Prospects National Team, worked for several months to overcome his anxiety. But he also considered quitting baseball altogether.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be fragile, right?

And so I had to have that conversation with them where I was like, don\u2019t treat me as fragile,\u201d Chappel said.\nSports psychiatrist David McDuff said this is common for athletes of Chappel\u2019s age.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see some individuals just get sick and tired of their life being way too sports-centered, and they\u2019ll burn out, and they drop out,\u201d McDuff said.\nChappel spent countless hours in therapy sessions, holding tight to his love for the game and hoping to return to form. Eventually, the Miami University commit made his way back to the mound.\n\u201cIt was better than Christmas day,\u201d Chappel said. \u201cJust being able to feel like I accomplished it\u2026 I struck people out, and I mean that\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019ll never have that feeling again.

But DeSue, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia, did not know how to open up to his family, friends, coaches and teammates.\n\u201c[Mental health] is just seen as a weakness,\u201d DeSue said.\nDeSue finally began to share his anxiety with those close to him and started going to therapy. He soon realized that he might be happier without football.\n\u201cI loved Maryland so much that it was hard for me to step away,\u201d DeSue said.\nLike Chappel, DeSue remains content with his decision.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve always tried to be myself, but I feel like now I\u2019m unapologetically like myself,\u201d DeSue said.\nBehind the scenes\nDaniel McMahon, the principal of traditional basketball powerhouse DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Md., has declined multiple offers for the school to join NIBC in part because of the pressure athletes can face \u2014 the same pressure that Patterson felt in his first nationally televised game.\nThe NIBC is an elite basketball league comprising 10 high schools around the country, with multiple All-Americans on its rosters and plans to further expand.\n\u201cI began to wonder really how any high school student that has that kind of success, that kind of promise \u2014 how did they survive mentally,\u201d McMahon said.\nRashid Ghazi, the commissioner of the NIBC, argues that such pressure drives young athletes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no different than if you asked a question about a kid who wants to go to Juilliard and study ballet or a kid who decides to pack their bags up and move to L.A. because they want to become an actor or an actress at a young age,\u201d Ghazi said.\nThe league currently leaves mental health programs up to each school, Ghazi said. However, they are working on an \u201coff-the-court\u201d program to teach athletes about subjects including mental health, finance, social media and diversity and inclusion, according to Ghazi.\nFor athletes at NIBC participant IMG Academy, a boarding school in Bradenton, Florida, a mental health care provider, a clinical sports psychologist and a psychiatrist are available to students on campus. Twelve mental performance coaches regularly work with the athletes.\n\u201cWe may help mitigate some of the mental health challenges if we\u2019re proactive and work with them on different coping mechanisms,\u201d IMG director of personal development Duncan Simpson said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAbove all, health professionals and program directors emphasized the importance of a healthy environment and support system.\nFor Dr. Keith Adams, support goes beyond individual school programs. Adams created the CKA Save Project to help student-athletes with motivation, time management, and the ability to help self-advocate.\n\u201cWe\u2019re of the belief that if you provide people with structure, which is simply boundaries, discipline, accountability and support, you can achieve a lot,\u201d Adams said.\nLicensed clinical professional counselor Parker Tims urged that it is critical to remember that these young athletes are still human and still kids.\n\u201cAthletes are people, and this expectation that they\u2019re high performing and fit and motivated would mean that they are not susceptible to the same human experience as the rest of us,\u201d Tims said.\nMedical professionals and directors all stressed that it is the duty of the athlete\u2019s coaches, parents and even school staff to ensure the competition stays healthy and that the athlete can access help and ask for it.\n\u201cMy hope is that in time people will be less scared of it [anxiety]. You know, that like fear of fear itself. That it\u2019ll be something people are more aware of and able to work with, so it won\u2019t be as limiting an issue it\u2019s been,\u201d Kaufman said.\nAthletes agree. DeSue encourages anyone who might be enduring a similar experience to put their needs first.\n\u201cYou have to do what\u2019s best for you, no matter how it makes anybody else feel,\u201d DeSue said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be happy and make other people happy if you\u2019re not working on yourself first.\u201d",

    "summary": "While most sports fans approve of legalized betting on professional sports, there is significant concern and less support for betting on college sports due to fears of exploitation and historical scandals involving point-shaving and game-fixing among college athletes.",
    "content": "When Tom McMillen discusses college sports and legalized gambling, he\u2019s straightforward about his concern. He fears a game-fixing scandal that would shake the confidence of fans across the country. \n\u201cI would say 99 percent of the sports-betting scandals that have occurred had been in the college market,\u201d said McMillen, a former U.S. Congressman and basketball All American at the University of Maryland.\nTwo of the most high-profile betting scandals in sports history have occurred at the college level. Boston College\u2019s basketball program was ensnared in point-shaving controversy in the 1978-1979 season. In the 1950-51 season, City College of New York (CCNY) and at least six other schools were involved in a notorious incident involving players being paid to throw games. \nWith legal betting now an option for most fans,  \u201cI think there\u2019s just that general fear that college kids could be exploited in this environment,\u201d said McMillen, now CEO of LEAD1, an organization that represents athletic directors and programs of the Football Bowl Subdivision, \nSports fans generally welcome sports betting, according to a recent poll conducted by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the university\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and The Washington Post.\nHowever, a survey of 1,503 people found less support for betting on college sports compared to betting on professional sports. In the Povich Center-CDCE-Post survey, 66% of respondents approved of legalized betting on professional sports. Just 55% supported legal betting on college sports. \n\nRyan Ridgeway, a 30-year-old warehouse worker from Laurel, Maryland, supports betting on professional sports but is wary about college sports because of the varying player finances.\n\u201cAt the professional level, they\u2019re already getting paid millions of dollars, I feel like they\u2019d be less likely to throw a game,\u201d he said. \u201cSince [college athletes aren\u2019t] getting paid millions of dollars, they have more of an incentive to throw a game.\u201d\n\nRichael Faithful, a consultant who lives in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, DC., also expressed reservations. \n\u201cMy concerns there are that betting will continue to influence how college officials and the college regulatory bodies treat student athletes,\u201d they said. \nOf the 30 states and D.C. that have passed legalized sports betting laws, 18 have some level of restriction on gambling on college sports. Virginia does not permit in-state betting on college sports. To place a bet on the University of Virginia or Virginia Tech requires crossing a state line into Maryland or West Virginia, for instance. In Maryland, wagering on both college and pro sports is only permitted at retail locations.\nThe ubiquity of mobile betting is a concern of  gambling-addiction experts. Dr. Deborah Haskins, the President of the Maryland Council on Problem Gambling, said that being able to place bets on a cell phone lowers the barriers for gamblers, particularly those prone to compulsive behavior. \n\u201cIf they\u2019re betting electronically, they can stay in the game longer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more people who are experiencing negative harms from gambling because now they can literally stay in the game 24/7.\n\u201cGambling beyond your means economically \u2026 you\u2019re spending more and more beyond what your budget is,\u201d she said, adding that compulsive gamblers sometimes resort to drastic measures like using mortgage and rent money for gambling,\u201d Haskins added. \n\nIn the Povich Center-CDCE-Post poll, concerns about sports gambling among younger fans was evident. Sixty-eight percent of respondents supported a minimum betting age of 21, compared to just 32% that supported a minimum age of 18. \nTwenty-four states set their minimum gambling age to 21, with six states and Washington D.C. dropping it to 18. In Virginia and Maryland, the minimum age to gamble is 21. \n\nIn the poll, 20% of sports fans said they had bet on pro sports in the past five years compared to 17% of all respondents, Regarding college sports, only eleven percent of sports fans said they had bet in the last five years compared to nine percent of all respondents.",

    "summary": "A recent poll shows majority opposition to transgender women competing against cisgender women in sports, influenced by media portrayal and societal attitudes. However, the survey also indicates growing social acceptance of transgender individuals, with 40% viewing it positively for society.",
    "content": "Phillip Westry is legal director at Free State Justice, a Maryland organization that acts as an advocate for members of the LGBTQ+ community. When he saw a poll showing most Americans oppose transgender women competing in sports against cisgender women, it confirmed what he\u2019d already suspected.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the polling,\u201d Westry said. \u201cI think some of the media coverage, especially with organizations like Fox News, oftentimes use the trans community and marginalized folks in general as a boogeyman.\u201d\nAdvocacy groups like Westry\u2019s aren\u2019t alone in thinking about the future of trans women and their place in sports competition. Sports leagues and organizations across the world are grappling with the question of whether to separate cisgender and transgender women in sports.\nFederation Internationale de Natation (FINA), the world\u2019s swimming governing body, said earlier this month that it would not allow most transgender athletes to participate in elite women\u2019s events. The organization said it will try to create an \u201copen\u201d category for swimmers who have a gender identity that does not match their sex.\nRecently, the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the university\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and The Washington Post, surveyed 1,503 people for their views of transgender girls and women in sports competitions. \nThe poll shows considerable opposition to transgender women and girls competing against cisgender women and girls at all levels. \nBut the poll also reflected increased empathy for members of the trans community. Forty percent of respondents said \u201cgreater social acceptance of transgender people\u201d was good for society \u2014 higher than the 38% that said so in a July 2021 Pew Research Poll. \n\n\n\nIn the Povich Center-CDCE-Post poll, 55% of respondents answered that they are opposed to letting transgender girls compete with cisgender girls in high school sports. For college and professional sports, that was 58%. \nForty-nine percent of respondents said they oppose letting transgender girls participate in youth sports. \nOf those surveyed, 28% said transgender women and girls should be allowed to compete in professional and college sports alongside cisgender women and girls, 30% for high school sports and 33% for youth sports. \n\n\n\nThose who support excluding transgender women and girls from competing against cisgender women and girls in sports point to a competitive edge they believe the transgender athletes would have. \nSixty-eight percent of respondents in the Povich Center-CDCE-Post poll said that transgender girls would have an advantage over other girls in youth sports. \n\n\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I understand that if you spent half your life with testosterone, your bones and then you got larger muscles, then, I mean I think there was a reason why they separated out the two to begin with,\u201d poll respondent Thomas Cherry, a 47-year-old software engineer in Baltimore County, said.\nHe noted that his view could change in the future as more information about transgender athletes becomes available. \nBladensburg\u2019s Tim Woody, another respondent, had a different view. The 49-year-old accounts manager for a flooring distributor said that separating transgender and cisgender girls in sports concerned him because it could lead to mental health issues.\n\u201cIf a [transgender girl] can\u2019t play a game because everybody else doesn\u2019t understand it might lead to more of a suicide rate where something that they want they can\u2019t achieve. It labels them for possibly the rest of their life,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAt least 18 states in the United States have banned transgender women and girls from competing with cisgender women and girls on sports teams. \nEarlier this year, Republican Maryland House Delegate Kathy Szeliga introduced the \u201cSave Women\u2019s Sport\u2019s Act,\u201d a bill that would have had similar effects. It was defeated in committee.\nSzeliga, who said she plans to re-introduce the bill and narrow its scope to just apply to high school sports, said the bill and the larger movement was not about transgender people but instead was about \u201cprotecting fairness in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly have no desire to limit anybody\u2019s opportunity to participate in sports, the sports of their choice,\u201d Szeliga said. \u201cHowever, when it comes to elite competition, I do think [cisgender] women need to be protected.\u201d\nBut some in the trans community voiced concerns about the impact that such restrictions could have on trans women and girls. \nNoted Lee Blinder, executive director at Trans Maryland, \u201cI think we really need to be very cautious and look to the examples of how we\u2019ve already failed our young people and ensure that we are not creating a binary that doesn\u2019t exist and therefore will always be failed.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Maurice \u201cMo\u201d Creek one day was a professional basketball player playing in Ukraine.\u00a0\nThe next day, he was a civilian in the middle of a war zone.\nIt was Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Creek was trapped in the city of Mykolaiv trying to figure out a way to get back home to the United States.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be a part of a war,\u201d Creek said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cNever in a million years did I think me going overseas to play basketball, I would be stuck in a war with people that are fighting for their lives.\u201d\nCreek, whose hometown is Oxon Hill, Maryland, played college basketball at Indiana from 2009 to 2013, missing one year due to injury before transferring to The George Washington University in the nation\u2019s capital. In his one season there, he was a Third Team All-Atlantic 10 selection, led the Colonials in points per game and helped propel them to the NCAA Tournament.\u00a0\nHe then went overseas starting in 2014 to play professional basketball. His journey took him to teams in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Israel, Romania and two different stints in Ukraine.\u00a0\nCreek returned to Ukraine for a third time in January to play for MBC Mykolaiv. At the time, the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine hovered over daily life, even though many Ukrainians dismissed the possibility of a war.\u00a0\nCreek\u2019s team, too, downplayed the threat, knowing there had been previous threats of Russian invasions and nothing had happened beyond the conflict raging since 2014 in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\u00a0\n\u201cWe had meetings about the situation\u2026and the owner, the coaches, were just basically saying everything\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d Creek recalled.\u00a0\n\u201cEven though you hear about the speculations of war, you just didn\u2019t think it would even actually happen because it didn\u2019t happen in the prior years,\u201d he said.\nSome of Creek\u2019s teammates began to flee the country and Creek himself wanted to leave as well.\nBut things were complicated. MBC Mykolaiv had not paid Creek the money he needed to leave and he did not yet have his letter of clearance signed to go play for his new team in Qatar that his agent had helped him get.\u00a0\nBy the time all that was cleared up and Creek was finally ready to leave for Qatar, it was too late: the war had begun.\u00a0\nMykolaiv, being near the Black Sea, was one of the first cities targeted by the Russians. Creek was stuck trying to figure a way out of Ukraine as martial law was imposed.\nCreek found himself escaping from time to time to a bomb shelter when the air-raid sirens blared. In the shelter, he was without phone service and, cut off from the outside world, wondering if he was going to get out of Ukraine.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I went in the bomb shelter, I didn\u2019t know if I was getting home or not,\u201d Creek said. \u201cI thought I was gonna be stuck in Ukraine for a good little bit until the war was over with.\u201c\nBut Creek had someone watching over him from the United States: retired Army Lt. Colonel Erik Nordberg.\u00a0\nCreek said he had met Nordberg just once for only a few minutes at a clinic last summer involving the team Sideline Cancer, a team that plays under the auspices of the Griffith Family Foundation to promote pancreatic cancer research.\nNordberg told CNS he checked in on Creek\u2019s situation a lot leading up to the Russian invasion.\u00a0\nThe day after the opening of the war, Nordberg had come home late from a basketball game and was sitting in his bed when he told himself he had to help Creek. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t do something, if I don\u2019t put something together to get this guy out, he might not ever get out,\u201d Nordberg said. \u201cI only met (Creek) for a couple of minutes but he was somebody that was important (and) I could do something to save this guy\u2019s life. And I was going to do it.\u201d\nSo Nordberg went to work from his office in his Fairfield, Pennsylvania, home with plans to get Creek out of Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0\nNordberg communicated with Creek through the app Signal, giving updates and other important information.\nNordberg\u2019s first plan involved arranging for a car to pick up Creek and take him to the Ukraine-Moldova border.\u00a0\nBut the driver never showed.\u00a0\nNordberg tried to get a driver from Odesa to meet Creek in Mykolaiv. But that driver couldn\u2019t get out of Odesa.\u00a0\nNext, Nordberg told Creek he should cross a bridge to rendezvous with a ride to neighboring Romania. But the Ukrainians didn\u2019t allow Creek to cross the bridge.\nNordberg spoke on the phone at one point with one of Creek\u2019s assistant coaches in Ukraine.\u00a0\nBefore that phone call, that assistant coach hadn\u2019t made it a priority to help Creek escape, according to Nordberg.\nBut the conversation with Nordberg changed his mindset.\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe that somebody in the U.S. was setting up a way to get (Creek) out,\u201d Nordberg said. \u201cI think he understood then that we were serious about it. So then he became a little bit more willing to support and get (Creek) out.\u201d\u00a0\nOn Feb. 28, Creek called Nordberg, telling him that the assistant coach\u2019s family had a car and was going to use one of the routes Nordberg came up with to get out of Ukraine.\nAnd the plan worked, as Creek and his assistant coach\u2019s family drove west to the Ukraine-Moldova border.\u00a0\nThe ordeal wasn\u2019t quite over: Creek said he had to wait in the cold for nine hours, in line with thousands of people waiting to cross into Moldova.\u00a0\nNordberg said he worked with the U.S. consulate in Moldova to help make sure Creek got across when he reached the border.\u00a0\nAt last, Creek reached the checkpoint and crossed into Moldova. Then he made his way to Romania, where he stayed in a hotel room provided by Project Dynamo, a non-profit\u00a0 organization originally set up to help evacuate Americans and Afghan allies from Afghanistan that now is helping evacuate American citizens in Ukraine.\nNordberg said he didn\u2019t sleep for five days as he aided Creek in his dangerous exit from Ukraine. Nordberg bought a first-class plane ticket for Creek to get home.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to rest until he was home to his family,\u201d Nordberg said. \u201cMy mission wasn\u2019t complete until he was all the way back.\u201d\nCreek flew from Romania to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and then to Washington Dulles International Airport outside Washington.\u00a0\nWhen Creek stepped off the plane at Dulles, he was greeted by family, Nordberg, and others.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was like one of the best feelings in the world,\u201d Creek said. \u201cI was so happy to get off that plane, turn the corner and see my mom, my father there, my brothers (and) everyone else there.\u201d\u00a0\nBack in Ukraine, Mykolaiv is one of the cities that has suffered heavy damage in the war.\u00a0\nCreek said it\u2019s tragic what\u2019s happened to Mykolaiv.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the peaceful place that it once was when I was there,\u201d Creek said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a war zone\u2026 it\u2019s just bad.\u201d\nBut he offered his support to Ukraine to keep fighting and that he\u2019s praying for them.\nCreek said he\u2019s writing a book about his experience in Ukraine as well as what it\u2019s like to play overseas basketball.\n\u201cA lot of people got these dreams and aspirations of wanting to play professional basketball but a lot of people don\u2019t understand what it takes or actually what they have to go through,\u201d Creek said.\u201cI want to give people the real scoop about how this actually is before you go over there and kind of have to figure it out yourself.\u201d\nNordberg said he and Creek plan to call or text each other every year on Feb. 28 to mark the basketball player\u2019s escape from war and to talk about people they have helped during the previous year.\nCreek called Nordberg a \u201cguardian angel\u201d for helping him escape. Nordberg said he just did what he was taught to do by the military.\u00a0\n\u201cI use what skill sets I had to help (Creek), who was a very special person,\u201d Nordberg said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was at that clinic. And I\u2019m glad I met him and was able to help him.\u201d\nAll this happened because of one simple friendly conversation at a basketball clinic. Creek is forever grateful.\u00a0\n\u201cYou never know who you\u2019re going to talk to. You never know who you\u2019re gonna have a conversation with,\u201d Creek said. \u201cThe dude I had a conversation with that I wasn\u2019t even thinking about was the dude that saved my life.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's retail sports betting launched in December 2021, but mobile options have yet to be implemented due to delays by the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC). This delay has caused Maryland to miss out on significant revenue and tax opportunities from major sporting events like the Super Bowl and March Madness.",
    "content": "Nearly a year and a half after Maryland voters approved a sports betting bill, Maryland\u2019s sports betting industry isn\u2019t fully up and running.\u00a0\nMaryland entered the sports betting world in 2021 with Gov. Larry Hogan signing a sports betting bill into law on May 18, 2021,\u00a0around six months after Maryland voters approved the bill in November of 2020.\u00a0\nHogan was the first person to make a legal bet in the state on December 9, 2021, marking the start of retail sports betting in Maryland.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021, Maryland collected $469,297 in sports wagering tax, according to Maryland Lottery and Gaming. The taxes collected go to Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future Fund, a multi-billion dollar investment that aims to help families in marginalized communities build a stronger workforce and keep Maryland a place where people want to live and work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, among the five live casino-based sportsbooks in Maryland\u2013 Ocean Downs Casino, Live! Casino, Horseshoe Casino, Hollywood Casino and MGM National Harbor\u2013 there was a total handle (the total amount of money wagered by betters) of $16.5 million dollars in December of 2021.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWhile Maryland has entered the retail sports betting industry, they have yet to enter the online space. This is largely due to the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC) and its process. According to Legal Sports Report, \u201cPart of the SWARC\u2019s delay is their desire to run another disparity study on the industry.\u201d\u00a0\nSWARC has the task of awarding up to 30 retail sports wagering licenses and up to 60 mobile sports wagering licenses, while actively seeking to \u201cachieve racial, ethnic and gender diversity when awarding licenses,\u201d according to their website.\u00a0\nThe state has missed out on the online market for popular sports betting events, including the Super Bowl and March Madness. This means that Maryland has lagged behind in terms of revenue and taxes made in comparison to states with more established industries.\u00a0\nMaryland is one of several states that launched sports betting in 2021. Many of these states, including Arizona, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming, offer versions of mobile betting.\u00a0\nMany neighboring states, including West Virginia and Pennsylvania, also feature mobile sports betting, with Pennsylvania looking at the potential of becoming one of the biggest sports betting markets in the country, according to Legal Sports Report.\u00a0\nStates with mobile betting are seeing millions of dollars of tax revenue come into the state every month, including nearby states like Pennsylvania, with $11,302,201, New Jersey with $12,983,727 and Virginia generating $4,282,889 in sports betting tax revenue in the first two months of 2022 according to PlayUSA and the Virginia Lottery.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMobile betting in Maryland has the potential to bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue, with potential estimates projected to be over $30 million a year with the state\u2019s 15% tax, according to MarylandReporter.com.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are hopeful that these steps can be completed in time for mobile sports wagering to launch during the 2022 football season,\u201d said Maryland Lottery and Gaming Director John Martin in an email. \u201cMobile wagering is essential for the sports wagering program to produce the level of revenue that the state is expecting, and moreover, we know it\u2019s something sports fans are waiting for.\u201d",

Despite giving up significant draft capital, the move reflects the Commanders' urgency to improve after a tumultuous period marked by a name change and controversy surrounding their owner.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Coming off a mediocre 7-10 season, a tumultuous name change, and controversial allegations against their owner, the Washington Commanders needed to make a splash in the 2022 NFL offseason.\nAnd before the new league year has even begun, they\u2019ve landed a major piece to the puzzle.\nDealing three high-round draft choices, the Commanders traded last week for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Carson Wentz in a reported early blockbuster deal.\nHe\u2019s the newest hope for a team that has run through a long string of quarterbacks. Washington\u2019s football team hasn\u2019t won a Super Bowl since 1992.\nWentz, who spent five years previously with the Philadelphia Eagles, makes a return to the NFC East looking to bring stability to the position and lead Washington back to the playoffs.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting to Washington,\u201d Wentz said in a tweet. \u201cThis organization has a rich history and a roster full of talent. I\u2019m going to do everything I can this offseason to prepare for a special season, and I can\u2019t wait to see you at FedEx Field this fall!\u201d\u00a0\nIn addition to getting Wentz, the Commanders received a second-round draft choice and a seventh-round draft choice, both this year.\nThe Colts got second- and third-round draft choices this year and a conditional second-round draft choice next year.\u00a0\nThe trade comes after Washington reportedly inquired about a potential trade involving then-Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.\nBut the Seahawks ended up sending Wilson to the Denver Broncos in a blockbuster trade.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Washington is trying to make the best out of this situation,\u201d former NFL general manager Mike Tannenbaum said to The Spun. \u201cThey gave up a lot for a guy who is going to play with three teams in three years, but I don\u2019t think they had another choice.\u201d\nWentz will likely take over the starting role from Taylor Heinicke, who threw for 3,419 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions in 16 games played last season.\u00a0\nWentz does come with his own questions though, despite a quality statistical season with the Colts in 2021, where he threw for 3,563 yards, 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 17 games started.\nThat was highlighted most by a crushing season-ending loss in Week 18 to the 3-14 Jacksonville Jaguars that helped eliminate the Colts from playoff contention.\u00a0\nInconsistency has been a trademark of Wentz, whose play dropped off in his final year with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020 as well.\nThat\u2019s the risk the Commanders take, and time will tell if the gamble pays off.\u00a0\nBut at the NFL\u2019s most important player position, Wentz seems to be an upgrade over Heinicke and will be a better offensive scheme fit, according to former Washington Post and The Athletic writer Mark Bullock.\u00a0\nBullock says Commanders\u2019 offensive coordinator Scott Turner\u2019s Air Coryell offense, a system dedicated to throwing the ball deep down the field, is a better fit for the stronger-armed Wentz than for Heinicke.\u00a0\nCommon sense also says that Wentz\u2019s ability to throw deep will work better with speedy wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who has accumulated over 3,000 receiving yards in three seasons with the Commanders. Bullock says Heinicke\u2019s reliance on shorter passes held McLaurin back at times.\u00a0\nEither way, Washington\u2019s move towards a new quarterback was predictable once last season ended.\u00a0\nThe Commanders have had quarterback issues for years, and haven\u2019t found even moderate stability there since starter Kirk Cousins left after the 2017 season following three years as the full-time starter with the team.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at all opportunities there in terms of quarterback\u2026we are looking to upgrade that position and we\u2019re looking at every angle possible,\u201d Washington General Manager Martin Mayhew said at the NFL Combine in March before the deal was announced. \u201cThat is a big piece of the puzzle and what we spend there we can\u2019t spend somewhere else.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd Wentz could be worth his weight in gold, and the Commanders will pay him like it: Wentz is getting $28 million for the 2022 season. In return, Wentz will be under contract for the next three years.\u00a0\nIf Wentz doesn\u2019t work out in 2022, he has an out in 2023 in his contract that allows the Commanders to release him without spending any more money on him.\u00a0\nBut as Mayhew said, acquiring Wentz will prevent Washington from spending in other areas of need. To alleviate the hit, Washington recently reportedly released starting safety Landon Collins to clear cap space even though it opened another position for the Commanders to fill.\u00a0\nWith limited cap space, the Commanders still will look to bring back some of its own free agents like wide-receivers DeAndre Carter and Cam Sims - both potential weapons for Wentz - while also looking for more outside talent.",

The Rams' defense, led by Aaron Donald and Von Miller with crucial sacks on Joe Burrow, secured a 23-20 victory in a high-intensity finale.",
    "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On Feb. 6, 2020, Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle announced his retirement after 13 seasons in the NFL. Just over two years later, he entered his Super Bowl postgame press conference screaming, \u201cWorld champs, baby! Best in the world!\u201d\nWeddle returned to the Rams in January following the news that Jordan Fuller would miss the playoffs with an ankle injury. The 37-year-old signed with the practice squad but within a week was elevated to the active roster. The rest was history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really something you hear out of a book, a story, a fiction, a fairy tale,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cYou only wish that your name would be a part of it. Lucky me\u2026I\u2019m a world champion.\u201d\nWeddle and the Rams\u2019 defense were critical in the team\u2019s 23\u201320 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI on Sunday night, matching a championship game record with seven sacks on Joe Burrow.\n\u201cGuys were asked to step up,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cI just can\u2019t say enough about how much I love this group. They played for one another.\u201d\nIn a postseason full of nail-biting endings, the finale lived up to that intensity and ended with a bevy of Rams earning their first championship rings.\nBurrow\u2014the NFL\u2019s Comeback Player of the Year\u2014was pressured all night long, with the likes of defensive tackle Aaron Donald and linebacker Von Miller charging at the second-year quarterback across SoFi Stadium. Donald and Miller each finished with two sacks.\nThe defining moment for Donald came on a fourth-and-1 with under a minute remaining in the game.\nWith Cincinnati trailing by three points, Bengals receiver Ja\u2019Marr Chase made a key 17-yard pickup to put his team near midfield. The Rams needed to halt the Bengals or risk a loss or the threat of overtime.\nA nine-yard pickup followed by two neutral plays left the Bengals with two options on fourth down: Get a first down or go home. Burrow dropped back, but Donald brushed past his blocker and hurled the quarterback to the turf.\nBurrow managed to get the ball downfield before he hit the ground, but his throw was well beyond Samaje Perine\u2019s outstretched hands.\nDonald took off down the field toward the end zone. He held his hand up and pointed at his ring finger. He was about to get his first piece of championship jewelry.\n\u201cI wanted this so bad,\u201d Donald said in a postgame interview. \u201cI dreamed this, man. I dreamed this and it\u2019s surreal.\u201d\nThe ninth-year Ram was not the only member of the championship team to claim that elusive first ring. The receiving duo of Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. were instrumental in getting Los Angeles to the promised land.\nThe Rams struck first, using a 20-yard catch from Kupp to get deep in Bengals territory. Soon after, Beckham managed to reel in a highly-contested floater to give the team an early lead, with a moonwalking celebration to boot.\nLos Angeles earned the next trip to the end zone as well, although the team did concede a field goal to the postseason-perfect Evan McPherson between its back-to-back scoring drives.\nEarly in the drive, Beckham ripped through the heart of Cincinnati\u2019s secondary for a 35-yard reception. On the very next play, quarterback Matthew Stafford found Darrell Henderson on a wheel route to his left for another substantial gain. All of that led to Stafford finding Kupp wide open in the back corner of the end zone.\nHowever, Beckham suffered a non-contact injury to his knee at the end of the first half. The injury kept him sidelined for the entire second half, and without him, Los Angeles\u2019s offensive production wore thin.\nWhen it came down to it, though, nothing could keep the receivers or the Rams from a Super Bowl win.\nTrailing 20\u201316 with just over six minutes remaining, Stafford and Kupp connected four times for 39 yards on the game-winning drive. The fourth catch was a one-yard touchdown grab that put the Rams in front for the first time since Cincinnati\u2019s Tee Higgins burst out for a 75-yard touchdown on the first play of the second half.\nOn the same drive, Kupp broke Travis Kelce\u2019s 2020 record for most catches in one postseason. Kupp ended with eight catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the game, and with a record 33 receptions in the postseason.\nFor his efforts, Kupp was named Super Bowl MVP, the culmination of one of the best seasons by a receiver in NFL history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been the perfect team, the perfect setup,\u201d Kupp said. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful for everyone that\u2019s been around me.\u201d\nAfter Kupp\u2019s go-ahead touchdown, the Bengals still had just over a minute to try and retake the lead, but Donald\u2019s stop ended their season at the final hurdle.\nAs Stafford entered victory formation, a weight was lifted off his shoulders as well. In his first season with Los Angeles, he reached his first championship game and led the game-winning drive.\nIt was a storybook ending for the Rams\u2014and during his postgame press conference, Weddle wrote one final page. He announced he would be re-retiring and going back to his daily life. This time, however, he\u2019ll do so with a Super Bowl ring.\nJacob Richman is a senior at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

    "content": "A heavy rainstorm washed out the Frederick Keys\u2019 home-opener last Wednesday night at Nymeo Field at Harry Grove Stadium. But one ritual went off as planned \u2013 the singing of the national anthem.\nKeys\u2019 broadcaster JJ Michalski performed the anthem moments before rain pelted the announced crowd of 3,500. Amy Lester sought shelter from the storm next to a concession stand, but enjoyed the moment nevertheless. \u201cI thought it was fantastic,\u201d said Lester, who lives in Rockville. \u201cI\u2019m an all-American girl.\u201d\nLester associates \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d with her childhood. Her father, Roy Lester, coached the University of Maryland Terrapins football team from 1969 to 1971. She remembers hearing the national anthem at Terps games. For her, the national anthem is patriotic and uplifting.\nMichalski echoed that.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s the national anthem. You always think of everything that America\u2019s gone through to reach the point of freedom we have in 2021,\u201d he said.\nA majority of sports fans share those positive feelings.\nThe Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the university\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and The Washington Post, conducted a national poll of 1,500 U.S. adults. The online poll released recently found that 84 percent of Americans support the national anthem being played or sung before professional sporting events in the United States.\n\nAccording to the poll, four-fifths of White Americans and two-thirds of both Hispanics and Asian Americans reported positive feelings. However, 35 percent of Black Americans shared those perceptions, with 22 percent of Black Americans reporting negative feelings when they heard the anthem. In the poll, 23 percent of Black adults said that the anthem is hurtful or not representative of them.\n In addition to patriotism, poll respondents said they associated the anthem at sports events with pride, respect or honor for the country or military, and unity. Others said the anthem when played at a stadium or arena is \u201cjust a song,\u201d a \u201cformality\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t really have any relevance to me.\u201d\n\nNathan Rollins, who attended the Keys game, said he is a baseball fan and that the anthem is part of the experience of going to Harry Grove Stadium. Often, he joins a group of friends who come to the ballpark from Collective Church in Frederick. He said the most important thing to him is the community that he is a part of at the game\n\u201cI love baseball, it\u2019s nostalgic,\u201d Rollins said.\nFrederick is a fitting place to look at the legacy of the national anthem. Across the street from Harry Grove Stadium is the cemetery in which Francis Scott Key, who penned the national anthem, is buried.\nKey wrote the anthem during the War of 1812. About a hundred years later, it began to be played at sporting events.\nAccording to some accounts, the anthem gained popularity when it was played at the 1918 World Series during Babe Ruth\u2019s final postseason appearance for the Boston Red Sox.\nThat World Series was played against the backdrop of World War I. The toll of the war could be felt in the nation\u2019s economy, workforce, and even baseball.\u00a0In the series, Ruth, then a pitcher, turned in a 1-0 shutout over the Chicago Cubs. During the seventh-inning stretch, a military band played \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Players on the field placed their hands over their hearts. The crowd joined in.\nIn the years since, the anthem has been a source of national pride and at times a lightning rod for protest. Athletes have used the anthem to protest racism in America.\n\nIn 1968, U.S. Olympic medalists Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists during the anthem to advocate for human rights, during heightened racial tensions and the civil rights movement. In 1996, Denver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refused to stand for the anthem during an NBA game to protest anti-Islamic rhetoric.\nSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during a 2016 preseason game\u2019s national anthem to protest police brutality. His actions sparked national conversation.\nJim Jones of Woodlawn served in the military. Speaking at the Keys game, he said that Kaepernick\u2019s protest didn\u2019t necessarily bother him, but it raised issues of respect on a national level.\n\u201cThe national anthem shows that people have the freedom to protest,\u201d Jones said.",

Pulisic and Reyna are the two most important building blocks for the team and will be key if the USMNT wants to make an impact at the 2022 World Cup.\nOther notable players on the list include Juventus\u2019 Weston McKennie and FC Barcelona\u2019s Sergi\u00f1o Dest, both valued at $27.5 million, and RB Leipzig\u2019s Tyler Adams, who is valued at $22.0 million. All three of these players have had consistent roles on their respective teams this season and are important for the national team as well.\n\nAs of May 6, the USMNT has not yet begun qualification for the 2022 World Cup. They received an automatic bye to the third and final round of CONCACAF qualifying and will play their first match in the final qualifying round in September of 2021.\nThe team has an international friendly scheduled against Switzerland at the end of May before playing in the CONCACAF Nations League Semifinals against Honduras on June 3.",

    "summary": "Sham Chotoo initiated and grew a youth cricket program in Maryland from 50 sign-ups in 2012 to over 1,000 students by 2013, leading to the establishment of the Maryland Youth Cricket Association. By simplifying the game and appealing to American parents seeking alternatives, Chotoo created the first elementary school cricket league in the U.S., expanding the sport's reach and popularity among young players.",
    "content": "In 2012, Sham Chotoo went to the Bowie Boys and Girls Club with the idea for a sports program, something to offer an alternative to the basketball, baseball, football and soccer already available.\nCricket, he insisted, would be a fun alternative, and an intriguing secondary option for kids.\u00a0\nHe had 50 sign ups. The next year he had 100. And by the end of 2013, he said, he was teaching cricket to over 1,000 students in elementary schools around Maryland.\u00a0\nChotoo is at the center of a burgeoning movement in the state, one where cricket is growing, especially at the youth level.\u00a0\nChotoo, originally from Trinidad and Tobago, came to the U.S. and found cricket to be a subculture within Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties. While it thrived in those tiny enclaves, he and a small group of others believed the sport could grow \u2014 helping establish the Maryland Youth Cricket Association.\nAnd they\u2019re steadily working toward that goal.\nIt started with schools and local recreation centers, selling the sport as a taste of something different to parents who might want their children to play something else.\u00a0\n\u201cThe large number of interested parties were American parents who just wanted something different for their kids,\u201d Chotoo said.\nFrom there, though, it expanded. Soon there were elementary schools, then middle schools. Chotoo found that cricket was popular among students, and he tapped into the affinity for the sport, creating the first elementary school cricket league in the nation, pitting eight schools against each other in casual matches.\nIn that league, and in those schools, he played a modified version of the sport. The pads and helmets usually used by batsmen were left on the sidelines, and he switched out a hard leather ball for an easier-to-use vinyl one. It was a low-intensity game, but one that caught on quickly.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t have proper pitches, either, instead using blacktops in playgrounds, baseball diamonds, or rolling out special mats.\nBut he found that as the sport grew at the youth level, a competitive edge developed. So, in 2013, Chotoo helped launch the Maryland Youth Cricket League, formalizing the process outside of a school environment.\u00a0\nThat development came with some problems, though. Chotoo and his colleagues at the Maryland Youth Cricket Association wanted to offer a full-fledged version of the game, one with proper equipment and officiating \u2014 but there were no proper fields.\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody wanted a cricket pitch. We just didn\u2019t have them,\u201d Chotoo said.\nHowever, with funding, as well as petitioning for local government contributions, fields started to pop up. There are now 33 in Maryland, concentrated in Howard, Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties \u2014 giving the state the biggest youth cricket setup in the nation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with that infrastructure, the sport has grown exponentially.\u00a0\nThere are now 44 youth teams in Maryland and Virginia, playing at four different age groups. Maryland is home to the first all-girls cricket league in the country \u2014 alongside a well-established adult league.\u00a0\nThe talent pool has grown, too. Five of the 24 players on the United States Girls\u2019 U-19 team were from Maryland. And in 2019, Maryland sent a middle school student, Lisa Ramjit, to the women\u2019s national squad, where she took the U.S. team\u2019s first wicket in a match against Canada.\nThere are a number of rising stars on the boys\u2019 side, too. Wesley Jackson, a 13-year-old from Silver Spring, Maryland, plays for three teams, and spends five days a week training. On Sunday he smashed 235 runs in the season opener, breaking a state record.\u00a0\n\u201c230 sounded better than 200,\u201d Jackson said.\u00a0\nHis dad, Jason, has been swept up in the process. Wesley tried numerous sports as a kid, Jason said. But cricket was the one he settled on, after playing for one of Chotoo\u2019s elementary school teams.\nAnd things appear to be going well so far.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind since then,\u201d Jason Jackson said. \u201cBut we fell in love with the things our kids fell in love with.\u201d\nStill, Chotoo and the MYCA have loftier goals. They want more support from local governments to strengthen the facilities around the Maryland area \u2014 something Prince George\u2019s County moved toward with a bill in the General Assembly in March, though it failed to pass.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the national level, they might just be getting some help. After a tumultuous start in the early 2000s, Major League Cricket is revamping itself as a professional sport, with a targeted start date of 2022. The six-team organization will feature a franchise in Washington, D.C. \u2014 which Chotoo hopes will expand local cricket.\u00a0\nFurthermore, the International Cricket Council, the sport\u2019s global governing body, is making attempts to push cricket into underutilized markets \u2014 the U.S. among them.\u00a0\nAnd with that interest, Maryland just might be getting somewhere.\u00a0\n\u201cI hope that someday soon, kids will be able to put on NBC or ABC and see a cricket match,\u201d Chotoo said.\u00a0\nThere are undoubtedly further obstacles for youth cricket in the U.S.\u00a0\nFunding, though improving, isn\u2019t a priority. And though the game is spreading, it\u2019s not quite worked its way into the mainstream consciousness.\u00a0\nHowever, Chotoo is helping lead the charge in Maryland, one field, and one student at a time.\u00a0\n\u201cOnce kids get into cricket, they realize why it\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world,\u201d Chotoo said.",

That number rose to 69% if all attendees received a vaccine.\n\u201cBecause vaccinations are still not necessarily available to everyone who wants one, that factored into our decision not to require that,\u201d Bader added.\n\n \n\n \nSee more graphics from the Povich Center-CDCE- Washington Post poll here.\n\nSome fans, like 59-year-old Michael Ruggieri of Glen Allen, Virginia, do feel comfortable returning to games.\nRuggieri is a New York Mets fan who typically attends one or two games each baseball season.\u00a0\nHe explained that when he has received his second dose of the vaccine this week, he will be comfortable going to the ballpark.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe also said that he\u2019d prefer that everyone attending games be vaccinated, but recognized that probably wasn\u2019t feasible with some people opting not to receive the vaccine.\n\u201cIf they required everyone to wear a mask, I\u2019d feel comfortable,\u201d Ruggieri told Capital News Service.\n\u201cI would like it if there was some kind of reduction in crowds,\u201d he added.\nOther fans, like 35-year-old Jan Glover of Hopewell, Virginia, would only attend games if the teams and stadiums strictly enforced masking and social distancing protocols.\nWhen Glover attends games it\u2019s for the Richmond Flying Squirrels, the Double-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, as she\u2019s several hours away from both Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Nationals Park in Washington.\n\u201cIt would depend how much they\u2019re enforcing the masking, and you have to have space between your party and other ticketed patrons,\u201d Glover told Capital News Service.\nAt Camden Yards and Nationals Park, fans and stadium staff will be required to wear a mask \u2014 including when in their seats \u2014 except when eating or drinking.\nGaiters, bandanas and masks with exhalation valves won\u2019t be allowed.\nAt Camden Yards, signs and other notifications will be posted reminding fans before and during games to wear their masks.\nFans who don\u2019t comply with the mask mandate will receive two verbal reminders of the policy from ushers and will be ejected from the stadium after a third violation.\u00a0\n\u201cIf it does look there\u2019s an intentional attempt to not wear a mask, we will bring in security and have the individual ejected,\u201d Bader said.\n\u201cWe are taking this policy very seriously, if we feel that people are intentionally trying to skirt this policy we will have them removed from the ballpark,\u201d he added.\nSignage at Camden Yards in Baltimore encourages fans to wear their masks on August 19, 2020. (Photo credit: Baltimore Orioles.)\nAt sports venues in recent months, there have been isolated cases in which fans have refused to comply with mask mandates.\u00a0\nAt a National Hockey League game in Pittsburgh last month, 17 fans were ejected for not wearing masks, according to KDKA CBS Pittsburgh.\nMasking is one of numerous protocols that will be in effect on Opening Day for the Orioles.\u00a0\nThe team is selling ticket packages in pods of two, four and six seats.\u00a0\nEach pod will be socially distanced with fans unable to join other groups.\nThe Washington Nationals will be selling tickets in pods of 1-6 people, also socially distanced and with fans unable to join other pods.\nAt Camden Yards, fans who seat-hop and migrate to other seating areas will be reminded twice before being subject to ejection.\nIn an effort to prevent fans from congregating outside of their assigned seating pods, Camden Yards won\u2019t open until an hour before first pitch.\nFans will not be permitted to enter until after batting practice.\nThe delayed opening is in effect \u201cso that fans are not tempted to be running all over the seating bowl chasing home run balls and instead stick with their assigned pod area once they arrive at the ballpark,\u201d Bader said.\nOrioles fans socially distanced in their pod seating and wearing masks at a spring training game in Sarasota, Florida, on March 4. (Photo credit: Baltimore Orioles.)\nUnlike last season, both stadiums will be cashless and will require digital ticketing where fans access their tickets through the MLB Ballpark smartphone app.\nConcession areas at Camden Yards will have more barriers set up than usual and will also have decals marked on the floor directing people where to stand.\nAdditionally, fans won\u2019t be permitted to bring outside food and beverages into Camden Yards.\n\u201cWe also have made a significant effort for both our planned members as well as the general public to try and educate them in advance about our policies to make sure that when they arrive at the ballpark, they know what they\u2019re getting into,\u201d Bader said.\nAlso, there will be clear plastic barriers between fans and concession workers, in an effort to diminish contact and create a touchless experience.\u00a0\nAs an added safety measure, Camden Yards has 36 dual-sided hand washing stations around the stadium and over 175 hand sanitizing stations.\nDespite all 30 teams allowing fans this season, each stadium has varying capacity limits dependent on the safety protocols of their local jurisdiction.\nThe Orioles will allow up to 25% capacity at Camden Yards, while the Nationals will allow approximately 12% capacity at Nationals Park.\n\n \n\n \n\nSee more graphics from the Povich Center-CDCE- Washington Post poll here.\n\u201cWe are hopeful based on what we saw in Florida (at spring training),\u201d Bader said.\n\u201cWe were very heartened by the fact that fans did adapt very quickly to this significant change of what coming to a ballpark was all about,\u201d he added.\nThe Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington will be at full capacity this season, while the Boston Red Sox and Nationals have the lowest capacities at 12%.\nThe Rangers home opener was a sellout, with 38,828 fans in attendance as fans throughout the game gradually took off their masks.\nThese protocols will have been put to the test with the Nationals home opener on Tuesday and will continue with the Orioles home opener on Thursday.\n\u201cStadium capacity is probably the biggest (safety) factor and if people wear their masks,\u201d Glover said.",

As restrictions ease, motorsports are set to restart, bringing back the vibrant atmosphere of racing with engines roaring and fans cheering.",
    "content": "On a typical Saturday night at Maryland\u2019s motorsports facilities, a blaring voice on the public address system would welcome hundreds of fans through the gates ahead of another evening of racing action.\nSome fans would head straight to the seats to find the perfect spot to watch the show; while others wandered the small midway, perusing the racing memorabilia stocked with apparel from some of the weekend warriors in the pits as well as classic items from national racing legends.\u00a0\nIn the pits, a small line of cars would be waiting in front of a small shed for pre-race certification, while others sat on jack stands while the small crews hurried themselves with last-minute adjustments.\u00a0\nThe rumble of racing engines warming up would sporadically drown out the music as anticipation built. The first call would come for cars to line up at the entrance gate for practice runs before heat racing began.\u00a0\nSoon, the quiet hum of track prep vehicles was replaced by the deafening roar of race cars launching themselves past excited onlookers and flinging themselves sideways into turn one.\u00a0\nThe sights, smells and sounds of the local racing season where yet another facet of life put on hold when stay at home mandates from the COVID-19 pandemic brought life to a standstill last March.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were hoping that it was a very temporary shutdown that wasn\u2019t going to persist throughout the year,\u201d Lisa Plessinger, general manager of Hagerstown Speedway, told Capital News Service.\u00a0\nThe venerable speedway saw most of its regular season and major event schedule wiped out as the shutdown dragged from weeks to months.\nThose events included Monster Jam, a Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series event, as well as the Frank Sagi tribute race, held in honor of the longtime speedway announcer.\nWhen professional sports eventually restarted in May last year, they did so without spectators due to social distancing guidelines, something that local tracks like Hagerstown could not do.\nSports leagues and racing organizations like NASCAR were able to return without crowds in large part due to the multibillion dollar television contracts signed between the leagues and networks like FOX and NBC.\nTV deals like a $4.4 billion contract NASCAR signed in 2013 with NBC do not exist at the local level.\u00a0\nDespite the existence of streaming services for races, local tracks rely on entry fees from the teams as well as admissions from fans for a large part of their income.\nHagerstown Speedway attempted to operate with onlookers in a socially distanced manor, but the facility was ordered closed on July 2 for hosting fans by the Washington County Health Department.\nAccording to the directive, the track was also cited for numerous violations, including a lack of face masks and of signage on social distancing.\nBetween the closure and the limited amount of races, Plessinger said that Hagerstown made about $200,000 in 2020, down more than half of the projected $800,000 for a regular year.\u00a0\nRoyce Miller, general manager of Maryland International Raceway, a quarter-mile dragstrip in Mechanicsville, Maryland, said his facility suffered \u201ctremendous economic downturn\u201d due to racing without fans.\u00a0\nThe track reconfigured many of its events by removing the professional classes that would draw spectators and hosting ameatur teams that would normally serve to pad out the weekend run times.\nMillier said that the track was able to run all of its events without the pro categories, though at a cost of half their yearly revenue.\u00a0\nMiller declined to comment on specific dollar amounts.\nJason Miller, who promotes their largest event, the Haltech World Cup Finals, was forced to reconfigure the event into a time trial event called the Haltech Hail Mary Derby last November.\u00a0\nThe temporary event proved successful enough to earn a stand-alone date in May of this year.\nBoth Plessinger and the Millers hoped to have at least some fans in the stands to avoid more debilitating financial losses like those incurred last season.\u00a0\nTheir hopes were answered on March 9 when Gov. Larry Hogan, R, announced the repeal of many capacity limits on businesses, including the state\u2019s motorsports facilities.\nLarge outdoor sports facilities, including Hagerstown Speedway and Maryland International Raceway, could open to fans at half capacity, though in a socially distanced manner, including masks.\u00a0\nPlessinger said that extra ushers would be on hand to facilitate social distancing requirements and plenty of hand sanitizer stands would be on site.\nThe track would also enforce the state\u2019s mask mandate that remains in effect.\nIn a statement released on Facebook, Maryland International Raceway said \u201cWe are excited about having spectators back at MDIR and we cannot wait to see you all soon!\u201d\u00a0\nThe track reiterated in their statement that social distancing guidelines would remain in place.",

They are preparing multiple plans while adjusting to a new normal without sports, facing significant personal and professional disruptions.",
    "content": "VOORHEES, N.J. \u2014 Collegiate athletic directors across the state of Maryland are facing the same uphill battle as those in the rest of the country \u2014 unprecedented chaos \u2014 after the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s decision to cancel any remaining winter and spring sports seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore than one month after the initial, March 12 decision, the situation is as fluid as ever and there is no timetable to return.\nRight now, what\u2019s next is the biggest question any athletic director has had to face.\n\n\u201cWe gotta always be prepared,\u201d University of Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans told Capital News Service. \u201cI think we gotta have plan A, plan B and plan C, to a certain extent. We gotta start looking to the fall.\u201d\nEvans first heard about the news while with the Maryland men\u2019s basketball team in Indianapolis for the Big Ten Tournament \u2014 on a conference call with the other Big Ten athletic directors.\nHis situation wasn\u2019t unique, as other athletic directors were at conference tournaments or NCAA Championships across the country.\nCoppin State University Athletic Director Derek Carter was at the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Basketball Tournament in Norfolk, Virginia, when the news came down.\n\u201cThe women played their first game on Tuesday and the men were scheduled to play Thursday at 8 p.m.\u201d Carter said. \u201cBetween Tuesday and Thursday, the amount of change that occurred was unbelievable.\u201d\nIn a new normal, people are still getting adjusted to life without sports, and life in isolation. The loss stings for many.\nUnlike coaches and student-athletes, the day-to-day jobs of athletic directors are less on the field and more in the office, but office or not, this is new territory.\n\u201cI think for me, so much of my life is centered around sport,\u201d Frostburg State University Athletic Director Troy Dell said. \u201cSports have always been a huge part of my life. It feels like a big portion of my life is hollow right now. It\u2019s a huge void that I hope returns soon.\u201d\nFor some, it was unexpected. Others, like Navy Athletic Director Chet Gladchuk, had been following it from the beginning. Gladchuk, in particular, had the benefit of speaking with members of the Navy\u2019s medical staff, who had been following it since the initial outbreak.\nHe cancelled two European spring trips the week of the NCAA\u2019s decision: a men\u2019s soccer team trip to Scotland, and a women\u2019s soccer team trip to Italy. Once Italy emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot, the decision was swift and easy.\n\u201cIt was well-received,\u201d Gladchuk said. \u201c(The coaches and players) didn\u2019t push back at all. I think that everyone realized in the early going that this was a very serious issue.\u201d\nBeyond the reality of the sport being gone temporarily, athletic directors had to relay the cancellations to their teams, coaches and more importantly, the student-athletes.\nSince the decision, the NCAA came out with a ruling that allowed an extra year of eligibility for student-athletes at all levels participating in spring sports. However, initially, that wasn\u2019t a possibility.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, my heart goes out to (the student-athletes),\u201d Bowie State University Athletic Director Clyde Doughty Jr. said. \u201cYou only get four years to be a student-athlete and for those seniors, I feel really bad for them.\u201d\nNow, with it being a possibility, athletic directors across the country have to scramble to figure out how to incorporate those extra years of eligibility, especially for seniors who choose to return.\nThat\u2019s not a realistic possibility for every senior, as some have the ability to play professionally or have a post-graduate job already set up. Regardless, the consensus, at least among those within the state, is that the NCAA made the right decision at the right time looking back on it.\n\u201cThe spring eligibility, giving these kids the opportunity, potentially, to have their season back, I think is the appropriate response and a good decision and one that has the best interest of our students in mind,\u201d University of Maryland, Baltimore County Athletic Director Brian Barrio said. \u201cI\u2019m all for it.\u201d\nAs important as sports is in society, an event like this helps put the athletic world in perspective with what\u2019s going on in the real world.\n\u201cWhen you step out of your own job and your own industry, you understand that this is a nationwide, worldwide problem, and we all need to do our part to get past this,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s College Athletic Director Scott Devine said.\nSports might not be going on right now, but athletics programs are still keeping up on social media, like at McDaniel College, whose soccer team has participated in the \u201cToilet Paper Challenge\u201d, where players juggle rolls of toilet paper with their feet.\nMeetings are still being held virtually and athletics programs are still going on without sports, but one of the biggest things to come out of this pandemic is the support that has been shown across the country, especially for collegiate athletics.\nThousands of student-athletes have had their seasons cut short, but are continuing to keep up resolve in a time of uncertainty.\n\u201cThe students themselves have been outstanding, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Towson University Athletic Director Tim Leonard said. \u201cThey have handled it well.\u201d\nThis all leads back to what\u2019s next \u2014 and that\u2019s a great unknown. Right now, all eyes are set on the fall to get right back into the swing of things.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future will hold. We don\u2019t know whether we will be back in session in the fall,\u201d Salisbury University Athletic Director Gerry DiBartolo said. \u201cThe only thing that we can do is plan as if we\u2019re gonna be back in the fall and know that there might have to be adjustments made based on what happens.\u201d",

    "content": "VOORHEES, N.J. \u2014 Athlete eligibility and scholarship availability are two of the biggest questions college coaches are now tasked with moving forward as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the United States.\nOn March 12, the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced the cancellation of the remainder of winter and spring sports championships. Conferences across the country followed suit as the possibility of a shutdown swiftly became reality.\nThat meant coaches, particularly those in spring sports, had to abruptly tell their teams and players that their season was over.\n\u201cThat was probably one of the hardest things that I had to do, is to tell my team that we weren\u2019t going to be able to finish,\u201d Towson University women\u2019s basketball coach Diane Richardson told Capital News Service.\nThe Tigers had just finished up a walk-through before their first game of the Colonial Athletic Association Women\u2019s Basketball Tournament \u2014 where they were the defending champions \u2014 when she had to break the news to her players that the tournament was going to be cancelled.\nMany tears were shed in the locker room immediately following the news that ended their season.\nSome coaches, Like Richardson, had the ability to meet with their teams.\nNavy men\u2019s lacrosse head coach Joe Amplo was with the team after practice on the Thursday when the Patriot League and, subsequently, the NCAA, made their decisions.\nThe team was preparing for a Saturday game against Johns Hopkins University, but in a split-second, everything changed. Amplo told the team to sit tight.\n\u201cNormally, they would have left the facility,\u201d Amplo said. \u201cI said, \u2018Something\u2019s happening.\u2019 I said, \u2018I wanna be together if we find out some bad news,\u2019 so we just kind of hung out in the locker room for an hour or so until it was official.\u201d\nOthers, like Loyola University Maryland track and field coach Amy Horst, were more than halfway across the country in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships.\nHorst woke up to texts the morning of March 12 that the Patriot League was cancelling the remainder of its season. Then, inside the Albuquerque Convention Center later in the day, she became a spectator to colleges and universities finding out in the same space in real time that the NCAA Championships were cancelled.\n\u201cIt was like \u2018I don\u2019t even understand. This can\u2019t happen,\u2019\u201d Horst said. \u201c\u2018This is not something that I\u2019ve ever in my entire life as a coach thought would be something that could happen.\u2019 To be in that space, it was very surreal.\u201d\nFor those who had the ability to meet with their teams, like Richardson and Amplo, telling their players the reality of the situation was no easy task. All of the hard work that the players had put in for an entire offseason or an entire regular season was instantaneously lost.\n\u201cIt was a shocker,\u201d Coppin State University baseball head coach Sherman Reed said. \u201cA couple of guys were looking up and waiting for the next comeback to be, \u2018Coach is just playing around.\u2019\u201d\nReed\u2019s team was getting ready for a three-game set with Villanova. When he told Wildcats head coach Kevin Mulvey, his reaction mirrored that of the Coppin State players. The Big East would take the same route later that day.\nSpring sports coaches are now faced with even tougher decisions, as the NCAA ruled in favor of an extra year of eligibility for spring sports athletes. Fewer scholarships could become available as players weigh their eligibility possibilities.\n\u201cI was expecting that,\u201d Frostburg State University baseball head coach Anthony Williams said. \u201cWhat it ultimately did lead to (was) more questions: How is scholarship money going to be handled, and all of those sorts of things.\u201d\nFor players coming back, especially underclassmen, it\u2019s almost like having a taste of playing before playing a full season. But for the seniors, some might have played their final collegiate games.\nSeniors in military programs are deployed after four years, so unfortunately for them, their last games were already played.\n\u201cFor some guys, they were graduating on time and they have jobs lined up,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t essentially put their life on hold to come back for another year and incur the costs that it takes to go to school for another year. \u2026 But I know that at the end of the day, they have a lot of great memories and we were able to play 13 games together this spring.\u201d\nThe question now is about the future and what\u2019s next.\nIn the short term, that means keeping up with practice, which has been much tougher than expected for some.\n\u201cAll the high school fields or public parks or anywhere that has a lacrosse goal for most of my players to access has been shut down,\u201d Frostburg women\u2019s lacrosse coach Madelyn Manzoni said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have that equipment at their house, we just had to modify things, a lot of it.\u201d\nHowever, the main focus, the long-term focus, is preparation for next season, and even with an unknown end date to the pandemic, the plan is to prepare as if next season is going to happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d McDaniel College men\u2019s lacrosse coach Keith Euker said. \u201c\u2026The best thing that we can do now is continue to build relationships with our current players and also prospective recruits. \u2026 As of now, we\u2019re just gonna move forward like we\u2019re gonna be back normally.\u201d",

    "summary": "The cancellation of winter and spring sports seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic left college student-athletes, particularly seniors, feeling shocked and saddened as their seasons and opportunities for postseason play were abruptly ended. Despite the challenges, athletes like Loyola University Maryland\u2019s Peter Swindell and St.",
    "content": "CORRECTION: This story, which moved on the Capital News Service wire on April 22, 2020, previously said in the penultimate paragraph that Navy football starting cornerback and rising senior Cam Kinley was a future team captain for the 2020 season. He will be the senior class president of the class of 2021 for the United States Naval Academy. The story has been corrected. \nVOORHEES, N.J. \u2014 Student-athletes across the college sports landscape are faced with a new challenge amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic as seasons have been stripped away and preparations begin for next season, which could still be in jeopardy.\nWinter and spring sports came to an unfortunate end with the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s March 12 decision to cancel any remaining schedules. That meant for winter-sport athletes, their postseasons would be cancelled, and for spring athletes, more than 75 percent of their seasons were wiped away.\n\u201cI remember that week of practice,\u201d Loyola University Maryland men\u2019s lacrosse senior Peter Swindell told Capital News Service. \u201cEveryone was trying to focus, but their minds were all somewhere else.\u201d\nThe Greyhounds were set to play Bucknell on Saturday, March 14, but the Patriot League had also made the same call on Thursday.\n\u201cWe all knew at that point that it was going to happen just because of everything that was going on in the world,\u201d Swindell said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really seem real to any of us because it all happened so fast.\u201d\nA feeling of shock and sadness was shared by other student-athletes across the state and the country.\n\u201cFrom a baseball perspective, it was pretty upsetting for everybody as a whole because at St. Mary\u2019s this year, we had a pretty close-knit group,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s College (Md.) senior first baseman Jay Hammett said.\nThe Seahawks had gotten out to a 6-3 start when the news hit, and along with a closely bonded team, it killed any momentum the program had to compete for a conference championship.\nThis especially stung for the senior class, who had their final year competing in college abruptly cut short. The NCAA\u2019s recent ruling has granted spring sports athletes an extra year of eligibility.\nBut for winter sports athletes, there is no extra year, and now, thoughts of what to do after college have taken over.\n\u201cIn that moment, it didn\u2019t hit me,\u201d Towson University senior gymnast Ally Wesoly said. \u201c\u2026I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully processed yet for me, being a senior. I think this is gonna take a very long time to kind of work out and go through.\u201d\nFor those spring sports seniors, the decision becomes a tough one. Jackson Reilly, a senior on McDaniel College\u2019s men\u2019s lacrosse team, entered his name in the NCAA Transfer Portal, looking for another year while also looking for a master\u2019s program in business, something McDaniel doesn\u2019t offer.\nWhile that\u2019s a possibility for him, he treated the final game of his season as his final game in college and unlike some other schools, McDaniel was able to have closure. Their game on March 14 against St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland continued as planned, but it would be the final one of the season.\n\u201cThat Friday, we had just changed our practice time to the middle of the day,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cSo, for the first time in my four years, we changed our practice time and just happened to be our last practice ever. The whole week was just different.\u201d\nOn gameday, additional media outlets, like Inside Lacrosse, were in attendance, and highlights from the game were shown on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter that night, showcasing an 18-12 McDaniel victory.\nThe emotions hit him after the final whistle, and Reilly shed a few tears on the field. However, he treated the final result as if he had won it all.\n\u201cObviously, we weren\u2019t national champions, but it was pretty cool to win your last game,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cI never won my last game because I never won any state championships in high school. It was sad that it was over, but the way our last game went for us was perfect. That was the best game we had played all year.\u201d\nFor those who aren\u2019t seniors, preparation for next year has already begun. For spring sports athletes, the road is a bit easier, conferencing with teammates and coaches while practicing at home.\nThe toughest part has been figuring out ways to continue to practice, which can be difficult without full use of equipment. However, they are making do.\n\u201cAfter I realized this is going to go on for a long time, I needed to keep a schedule in mind,\u201d Frostburg State University men\u2019s lacrosse junior Shawn Winans said. \u201cSince we can\u2019t go to gyms now, I go to the turf. We have a couple tires there. I do turf workouts about three, four times a week.\u201d\nWinter and spring sports weren\u2019t the only sports affected as fall sports are now at a disadvantage going into the 2020 seasons, especially football. Spring practices are now Zoom workouts, but there is no timetable for when these will end.\nNavy football junior cornerback Cameron Kinley, the senior class president next year at the Naval Academy, grew up in a football family, so it\u2019s been easier for him to find workout partners at home.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s kind of back to the basics,\u201d said Kinley, who is at home in Memphis and must file a report with the academy every morning. \u201cMy dad is a former football coach. My brother is a freshman at MTSU (Middle Tennessee State University), so he\u2019s back home with me. We\u2019ve just been working out together just like we used to. I\u2019m fortunate enough to be in that type of situation.\u201d",

    "summary": "Jade Greene, a high school junior and shortstop, lost crucial exposure to college recruiters due to the pandemic suspension of her softball season. The NCAA's recruiting rules and financial constraints may further complicate her and other athletes' opportunities to secure scholarships.",
    "content": "BEAR, Del. \u2014 This spring was supposed to be Jade Greene\u2019s time to get noticed.\nA shortstop leadoff hitter for Bishop McNamara High School since her freshman year, Greene has been waiting for her junior season to gauge the interest of college recruiters.\u00a0\n\u201cI was banking on that because I really need coaches to come see me,\u201d said Greene. \u201cThis is the year where I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to get all these coaches to come see me and maybe I can commit this year.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t happen because we had no games for them to watch.\u201d\u00a0\nAn National Collegiate Athletic Association 2018 ruling prevented college coaches from contacting high school athletes until Sept. 1 of their junior year for softball and lacrosse. Now, with a suspended season and college applications due before the start of next season, Greene is just one example of the predicament the pandemic has caused for high school juniors hoping to take their games to the next level.\u00a0\n\u201cNow, of course, a lot of that comes down to what happens this summer,\u201d said Bishop McNamara assistant softball coach Paul O\u2019Brien. \u201cIf she\u2019s able to play in the summer, she\u2019ll recover just fine. That\u2019s a huge question mark right now.\u201d\nThe timetable of returning to normalcy during this pandemic is certainly the biggest question, as college spring sports coaches typically have more time to recruit during the summer and fall, when they\u2019re also in the offseason.\u00a0\n\u201cAdd on to that the (NCAA) extending the eligibility of current collegiate athletes, the junior class might be in a huge pinch as programs may not be able to financially do a ton of recruiting for that class,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSo, you have five classes getting scholarship money in one form for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nWhile the NCAA did allow schools to provide eligibility relief for spring sport athletes, they did so at the discretion of the schools.\u00a0\nFor example, member Ivy League institutions have traditionally ruled against allowing graduate students to play an extra year. Schools such as Princeton, Yale and Harvard have also begun to close a loophole that would have allowed student athletes to retain their extra year of eligibility if they withdraw from this semester\u2019s classes.\u00a0\nAside from recruiting concerns, Greene said, this was likely the last opportunity for Bishop McNamara, in Forestville, Maryland, to contend for the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference state title. After coming a run short in last year\u2019s semifinals, Greene said a large senior graduating class will likely leave the squad decimated next season.\u00a0\nGreene\u2019s teammate, senior pitcher Bailey Wilcox, was only 14 strikeouts away from setting the school record \u2014 a milestone O\u2019Brien said she would\u2019ve completed in two games if given the opportunity.\n\u201cIt really hits you there,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWhat these folks have been working on for the last four years is affected in a way that can\u2019t be fixed. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Bishop McNamara softball team is just one example of athletes all around the state missing out on chances to get recruited and achieve senior milestones.\nAaron and Andrew Ray, twins on the Loyola Blakefield high school track and field team in Towson, Maryland, were also banking on boosting their recruiting profiles. In a time-based sport that allows coaches to track down runners nationwide, Andrew said he was disappointed to not get the opportunity to improve his times before talking to college coaches.\u00a0\nWithout another opportunity to lower his times in the 300-meter hurdles race, exclusively an outdoor event, Andrew will have to go through the college application process with his current marks.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI was pretty excited for this season because I feel like I was bringing everything together.\u201d\nUnlike his brother, Aaron has started talking to college coaches from schools such as Lehigh, Dartmouth and Washington and Lee. Still, with a preference of going to a larger state school such as Maryland or Penn State, the potential loss of the full spring season has forced him to become more flexible.\u00a0\n\u201cIt pretty much means I\u2019ll be more open to walking-on in college if needed, especially with track and field and the way that college applications work,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cI might go to a college I might not have considered for track and field.\u201d\nFrom a coach\u2019s perspective, Georgetown Preparatory High School, baseball coach Chris Rodriguez told Capital News Service his message to his uncommitted juniors was to stay positive and take this time to be assertive, to introduce themselves to college coaches and keep them updated on what they\u2019re doing during the quarantine to get noticed.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do a whole lot right now other than try to be aggressive and stay in sight in some shape and form (with college coaches) that we already had connections with and try to make some new ones,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201c(College coaches are) not playing either, so they\u2019re probably in front of their computers as much as we are.\u201d\u00a0\nRodriguez, whose son Ryan is a sophomore on the varsity team, said he\u2019s nervous about the prospect of athletes not getting a chance to compete in the summer or fall when college coaches are more focused on recruiting. Still, his message to his team has been taking this time as an opportunity to get ahead.\u00a0\n\u201cYou just have to find a different way to engage,\u201d said Rodriguez, who\u2019s also the dean of students at the Bethesda, Maryland, school. \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together and we only have so many options, and I think it\u2019s going to be this way for a few more months. (We\u2019ve got to) deal with it, and get better.\u201d\u00a0\nGreene has taken this time under quarantine to be proactive in contacting colleges, including an innovative way to show coaches her skills while remaining in isolation at home.\nVIDEO: Greene Batting Practice\u00a0\nVideo of Greene hitting softballs in her garage. She said she sent this video to college coaches so they can see her play during the pandemic. (Courtesy of Jade Greene.)\u00a0\nFor other athletes around the state who\u2019ve already been through the recruiting process, the potential loss of a full spring season means a missed last opportunity to leave a legacy their senior seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\nRyan Calvert, a senior pitcher and heavy hitter for La Plata High School in Charles County, Maryland, baseball, was touted as a potential Major League Baseball draft selection following his spring season. In light of potential financial ramifications of the postponement of the season, the MLB is discussing shortening this summer\u2019s draft from 40 rounds to as few as five.\u00a0\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice to be drafted this year, but I really want to go to college and play baseball there and get my education,\u201d Calvert said. \u201cI\u2019m preparing for both so I don\u2019t want to leave any options out.\u201d\nFortunately for Calvert, if high school sports aren\u2019t resumed this spring, he\u2019ll end his high school career as a state champion after leading his team to the 2A title on the mound against Middletown, in Frederick County, Maryland, last May.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was fun watching him grow. He\u2019s always been big for his age but wasn\u2019t always very athletic. To watch his athleticism catch up to his baseball IQ and ability has been a lot of fun to watch,\u201d said La Plata head coach John Childers, who\u2019s coached Calvert the last six years. \u201cAnd to not be able to cap it off, fortunately, he got to win a state championship on the mound last year, but it\u2019s hard for him to not to get that chance to do it again.\u201d\nOther high school athletes weren\u2019t so fortunate to get that chance \u2014 at all.\u00a0\nSuch was the case with Gilman High School senior Dylan Walters, who said he\u2019s been dreaming of the chance to play No. 1 singles on the tennis team. After making varsity as a freshman, Walters has progressed up the depth chart to earn the spot his senior season.\u00a0\n\u00a0Photo Caption: Dylan Walters serving during a tennis match at Gilman High School. (Photo by Boo Smith.)\nWalters was nearly the No. 1 singles player for Gilman, in Baltimore, his junior season, but classmate Nick Boucher overcame him in the final match during tryouts. This spring, however, Walters said head coach Steve Krulevitz sat him down and said how proud he was of his hard work to secure the top spot for a team that has won the last six state titles.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to play No. 1 singles for Gilman, and I didn\u2019t get to do that,\u201d said Walters, who will play at Brandeis University next year. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly devastating.\u201d\nAt Baltimore\u2019s Boys Latin High School senior lacrosse attackman Brendan Grimes hoped to get another year of crucial development before heading to play for nearby Johns Hopkins University after missing his junior season from a back injury.\u00a0\n\u201cI felt that great feeling a lot coming into senior year,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cUnfortunately, that was taken away. For next season, to complete a full season would be great for me to get that confidence under my belt again.\u201d\nGrimes said he worked hard last year in physical therapy and did constant back and core exercises to get back into shape, something that helped him land a spot on the USA Under-19 national team roster. Now, he\u2019s hoping to use the same patience to continue to work on his game so he\u2019s ready for the next level.\u00a0\nFor Ella Mannix, a senior lacrosse midfielder for Boonsboro High School headed to play at Salisbury next year, hoped-for milestones like reaching her 100th goal and making another run to the 1A championship seem all but gone with the current status of the pandemic. She said she\u2019s been working since her freshman year to be nominated for the Player of the Year awarded by her local Hagerstown, Maryland, paper, The Herald-Mail.\u00a0\nBoonsboro lost in the state championship Mannix\u2019s sophomore year before losing to the same side, Patterson Mill, in the semifinals in 2019. Mannix said she was hoping for a chance to lead her team to another postseason run.\u00a0\nPhoto Caption: Ella Mannix with possession at Boonsboro High School. (Photo by Rob Brogaard.)\n\u201cWe had workout plans set and wanted to stay in shape so we can come back the same place we were when we got off these two weeks, but when they said the schools are being closed another four weeks it just kind of went downhill honestly,\u201d Mannix said before it was announced schools would be closed until at least May 15. \u201cIt\u2019s just really sad for all of us because it\u2019s the whole season we\u2019re missing out on that we had a lot of high hopes for.\u201d\u00a0\nFor high school coaches like Rodriguez and Gonzaga College High School assistant athletics director and head men\u2019s lacrosse coach Casey O\u2019Neil, they said it\u2019s now about trying to maintain a positive mentality and keep in touch through weekly meetings.\u00a0\nRodriguez said his assistant coaches at Georgetown Prep started a weekly baseball trivia night on Zoom, with the seniors dividing the squads into eight teams to compete. He said it\u2019s a fun way to stay connected.\u00a0\nO\u2019Neil\u2019s Gonzaga, in Washington, D.C., has also kept in touch with weekly Zoom chats and through a workout program that each player sends out to the team, organized by jersey number.\u00a0\nWhen Gonzaga lacrosse learned their season was suspended, they were getting ready for practice, planning to review a scout report the day before a game against rivals Georgetown Prep. After the news, O\u2019Neil gave the seniors three options: go home right away, play an intrasquad basketball tournament, or scrimmage with teams made up of Gonzaga players from Maryland and Virginia.\u00a0\nThe seniors chose the latter two options, taking every last minute to stay at the school with their team before leaving for a future of uncertainty.\u00a0\n\u201cThe guys used up all that time,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cOnce we played that game I had an emotional talk with them about the unknown and that they\u2019re cared about if they need anything. They didn\u2019t want to leave the field. They wanted to hang out and be together.\u201d",

Despite an early 35-15 lead, Northeastern faced a late rally from Elon but ultimately held on for the victory.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Senior Northeastern guard Jordan Roland hadn\u2019t played his best basketball throughout the CAA Conference Tournament. He came in averaging 22 points per game, but was held to eight in Northeastern\u2019s upset win over Towson Sunday. Monday, he missed his first four shots against Elon.\nBut when the Huskies needed him most, as Elon drew within seven points in the closing minutes, Roland drained back-to-back threes to extend their edge to 63-50 with 1:33 to play. The sequence effectively sealed a 68-60 win that propelled Northeastern into its third straight CAA championship game.\nRoland scored 10 of the final 12 points for the Huskies to lead all scorers with 21 points. His teammate and fellow senior guard Bolden Brace went 4-for-6 from beyond the 3-point line and finished with 16 points.\n\u201cWe got a little lax in the second half in terms of our execution,\u201d said 14th-year Huskies head coach Bill Coen. \u201cYou could feel the momentum start to swing a little bit.  But fortunately, [Roland and Brace] stepped up and made some huge shots to stem the tide.\u201d\nElon was led by graduate transfer Marcus Sheffield II, who scored 20 to end his career. \nNortheastern fired on all cylinders in the first four minutes. It jumped to a 9-0 lead by the first media timeout.  Redshirt junior Maxime Boursiquot scored four early points and forced two steals in the first half. \nSecond chance opportunities were key for Northeastern early as it grabbed four offensive rebounds in the opening 7 1/2 minutes.  Back-to-back threes by Brace and freshman guard Tyson Walker stretched the Huskies\u2019 lead to 15-5 and prompted a timeout from Elon\u2019s first-year head coach, Mike Schrage.  \nNortheastern pushed the lead to 26-10 with 7:15 left in the first half, which prompted Elon to employ a 1-3-1 zone to throw off their opponents. But that didn\u2019t work, either. The Huskies went on a 7-0 scoring run in just under two minutes and pushed their advantage to 35-15 with four minutes to go in the half.\nElon fought back gradually through the second half. The Huskies went on a seven-minute scoring drought. But the Phoenix weren\u2019t opportunistic enough as it scored just eight points during that span.\nBut Elon made history by reaching the CAA semifinals for the first time in school history. It entered the tournament with an 11-20 record, seeded seventh.\n\u201cA lot of teams get sick of each other, it\u2019s a long season,\u201d said Schrage. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense it one bit from these guys ever\u2026it\u2019s a launching pad.  We believe in elevating this program to amazing heights.\u201d\nElon fans gave their team a standing ovation after the final horn.\nNortheastern moved on to the title game scheduled Tuesday, where the team it beat last season in the title game, Hofstra, waits again. The Huskies bested Hofstra 82-74 a year ago, but lost twice to the Pride during the regular season by a combined six points.\n\u201cOur core group of guys never lost belief in themselves and that\u2019s hard to do when you go through a season like we went through,\u201d said Coen.  \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t catch a break.  But this team came to practice each and every day with a positive attitude.  I always say when you take that approach, somewhere along the line, your fortunes are going to turn.\u201d",

    "summary": "Hofstra secured their spot in the CAA basketball final with a 75-61 victory over Delaware, thanks to Eli Pemberton's 24 points and the team's effective defensive strategy. The game was largely decided by halftime, with Hofstra leading 40-28 and maintaining control throughout.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With Hofstra leading Delaware 35-22 in the first half of their CAA tournament semifinal, Hofstra forward Stafford Trueheart lost control of the ball, only to save it from bouncing across the half-court line for a backcourt violation at the last moment. Truehart then immediately passed to guard Eli Pemberton, who promptly knocked down his fourth 3-pointer Monday.\nThat moment at the Entertainment and Sports Arena reflected what went right for No. 1 seed Hofstra, whose made field-goal percentage from behind the 3-point line and Pemberton\u2019s leadership were significant factors in their 75-61 victory over No. 5 seed Delaware in a rematch of last year\u2019s CAA tournament semifinal. \nPemberton continued his rich scoring form, making 7 of his 15 field goals, including 5 of 8 from behind the 3-point line, to finish with 24 points. \n\u201cThis game, they knew I was going to attack the rim, so I had to mentally prepare,\u201d Pemberton said. \u201cWe have great guards and they found me for those shots.\u201d \nCenter Isaac Kante was the game\u2019s biggest physical presence and used all of his 6-foot-7, 240-pound frame to haul in 11 rebounds.\nLast year when these two teams met each other it took overtime to separate them. Monday the game looked largely decided by halftime when Hofstra staked a 40-28 lead. \nHofstra found Pemberton early, while Delaware had difficulty creating any type of space for its key man, Nate Darling. Darling was forced to take low-percentage shots in an effort to keep Delaware from slipping further behind. \n\u201cThis defense that we play,\u201d said Hofstra head coach Joe Mihalich, \u201ceveryone has a name for it. People think it\u2019s a matchup, people don\u2019t like it. We love it. The credit has to go to our assistant coach Mike Farrelly. He\u2019s like a mad scientist. \n\u201cIt starts with our scouting \u2026 our standard for preparation is high,\u201d he continued, explaining that Farrelly adapts the team\u2019s defensive strategy to the opposition\u2019s most dangerous threat.  \nHofstra guards Pemberton, Desure Buie, Tareq Coburn and Jalen Ray experienced victory for the second time in a semifinal over their CAA rivals. For Delaware, Ryan Allen and Kevin Anderson were the only players that remained from their team that suffered defeat last year.\nHofstra faces No. 6 seed Northeastern in the final of the conference championship, scheduled for Tuesday at 7 p.m. The Huskies defeated Elon, 68-60, to advance.\nHofstra lost the CAA championship game last year to Northeastern, 74-82. \n\u201cIt means everything to us,\u201d said Pemberton, when asked what winning the tournament means to the team. \u201cWe worked for it all year.\u201d",

Defenders.\nHaving been subjected to many recent losing seasons from the local NFL team, like its 3-13 2019 finish, some D.C.-area football fans see this team as a much-needed change of pace. The Defenders trailed early in the game, but came back to beat the Seattle Dragons, 31-19.\u00a0\nMax Alpert, a lifelong fan of Washington\u2019s NFL team, was pleased to see some winning football.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing a Redskins fan, I am just hoping for some good football in the D.C. area. Never in my life have I fallen asleep during the Redskins\u2019 games until this season, it was just that boring,\u201d Alpert told Capital News Service on Monday.\u00a0\nAlpert said the atmosphere Saturday seemed better than the usual scene at FedEx Field, the home of Washington\u2019s NFL franchise. \u201cYou can also tell the atmosphere is a lot better than FedEx Field. When going to FedEx you feel like you\u2019re at an away game, when going to Audi you know you\u2019re in Defenders territory.\u201d\nExcited D.C.-area sports fans and analysts \u2014 some pretty influential \u2014 used the win as an opportunity to poke fun at Washington\u2019s NFL team.\n\nDC Defenders vs. Redskins. Who you got?\n\u2014 Mike Clay (@MikeClayNFL) February 8, 2020\n\nESPN NFL analyst Mike Clay jokingly asked followers if the Defenders could beat Washington\u2019s NFL team if the two matched up on the gridiron, and popular restaurateur David Chang, who grew up in the D.C. area, firmly declared that the Defenders are the area\u2019s best football team.\u00a0\n\nThe DC Defenders are the best football team in the Washington DC area\n\u2014 Dave Chang (@davidchang) February 8, 2020\n\nWhile many football analysts would credit the Defenders\u2019 win to quarterback Cardale Jones\u2019 235 yards and two touchdowns and a defense that recorded two interceptions, head coach Pep Hamilton said fans deserved a lot of credit.\n\u201cIt sounds cliche, but it wasn\u2019t today. We owe this victory to the fans,\u201d Hamilton said after the win, according to the official XFL website. \u201cWhen we got close to \u2018bend or break\u2019 situations, they kept us upright. They were loud from start to finish and gave us the energy we needed to finish the job and get the victory.\u201d\nIn addition to the strong showing in the stands for the Defenders, fans have been eager to support the team by purchasing merchandise. According to the Defenders\u2019 official online store, many products have already sold out, including many of the hats offered, various sweatshirts and T-shirts and the team\u2019s authentic game football.\nThe Defenders play four more games in D.C. this season, including this Saturday against the New York Guardians.",

    "content": "MIAMI \u2014 With the Kansas City Chiefs trailing the San Francisco 49ers by double digits in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIV, Patrick Mahomes was tasked to with a daunting mission. No starting quarterback in league history had ever led three such postseason comebacks. But once again, Mahomes showed he is unlike any other quarterback that has graced the NFL.\nThe second-year starter threw two touchdown passes in the final six minutes to beat the 49ers, 31-20, at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday night and give the Chiefs their second title in franchise history.\nWith the victory, Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl and a league MVP (a feat he accomplished in 2018). He also became the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP.\nWhen the Chiefs took possession down 20-10 in the fourth quarter, those accomplishments seemed unlikely. San Francisco\u2019s defense had played as well as advertised, constantly attacking Mahomes and forcing two interceptions in the third quarter.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play to my liking in that third quarter,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cBut the guys believed in me and gave me confidence.\u201d\nKansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP after leading the Chiefs to a comeback 31-20 win against the San Francisco 49ers. (Ryan McFadden/Capital News Service)\nFacing a third-and-15 with seven minutes remaining, the Chiefs needed Mahomes to replicate the same magic he had showed earlier in their postseason run. He had already led the team to double-digit comebacks in their two previous playoff wins against the Houston Texans and the Tennessee Titans.\nSo Mahomes did just that. He moved out of the pocket and threw a 44-yard strike to wide receiver Tyreek Hill, then followed it up with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Travis Kelce to pull Kansas City within three points of the lead.\n\u201cYou knew those guys had their ears pinned back and they were going to be rushing,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI think the offensive line gave me enough time to throw a really deep route and Tyreek made a really great play.\u201d\nThe Chiefs\u2019 defense, who got trampled by the 49ers\u2019 run game through the first three quarters, buckled down and forced a three-and-out with five minutes left on the clock, giving Mahomes a chance to cement his legend.\nAfter Mahomes zipped a 38-yard pass to wide receiver Sammy Watkins, he threw a five-yard touchdown to running back Damien Williams. The Chiefs fans in the crowd let loose a roar as their team took a 24-20 lead with less than three minutes to play.\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic Mahomes,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be himself no matter what the scenario is.\u201d\nThe 49ers failed to convert a fourth down on their next possession and handed the ball back to the Chiefs. Two plays later, Williams broke up the left sideline for a 38-yard touchdown run that put the exclamation mark on Kansas City\u2019s first Super Bowl in 50 years.\nMahomes threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown. Williams rushed for 104 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Hill caught nine passes for 105 yards.\nSan Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo bested Mahomes early but faltered late. With 57 seconds remaining, he threw an interception to Kansas City cornerback Kendall Fuller that sealed the Chiefs\u2019 win.\nKansas City\u2019s offense retook the field, and Mahomes threw the ball in a long arc as the final seconds ticked away. Confetti shot out as the Chiefs embraced one another, knowing their city can finally rejoice after decades of waiting.\n\u201cJust to be here is surreal,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy this for a long time.\u201d\nRyan McFadden is a student in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism master\u2019s degree program.

This is the 11th time the Super Bowl will be played in Miami, which has hosted the game more often than any other city.\nThe first Super Bowl of the new decade will be a battle between a high-powered offense in Kansas City and a rigid defense in San Francisco.\nThe Chiefs, who are led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have the third-best offense in the league, generating 419 yards per game. Mahomes has an arsenal of skilled and speedy receivers that can help turn the tide of any game. The 2018 MVP has been perfect through two playoff games, throwing for 615 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions.\nSan Francisco, which is ranked first in total defense, has allowed only 83 rushing yards in the postseason. The 49ers\u2019 defensive line, which consists of Arik Armstead, rookie Nick Bosa, DeForest Buckner and Dee Ford, was the only group to each record 6.5 or more sacks during the regular season. Cornerback Richard Sherman\u2019s stellar play throughout the regular season has translated into the postseason; he has recorded an interception in every playoff game.\nOffensively, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has been solid after tearing his ACL a year ago. But it\u2019s the 49ers\u2019 run game, which is ranked second in the league, that\u2019s been doing wonders for the them.\nBoth teams feature two of the top tight ends in the league. Kansas City\u2019s Travis Kelce and San Francisco\u2019s George Kittle were their quarterbacks go-to targets, as they each lead respective teams in receiving yards.\nMatchup: San Francisco 49ers (13-3) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (12-4)\nGame time: 6:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami\nWhere to watch: Fox\nHow the Chiefs got here:\nThe Chiefs earned a trip to the Super Bowl for the first time in 50 years after beating the Tennessee Titans in the AFC championship. The Chiefs trailed 17-7 before scoring 28 unanswered points to run away with a 35-24 victory. The Chiefs also executed a comeback victory in the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans. Mahomes threw five touchdown passes to overcome a 24-0 deficit and beat the Texans 51-31.\nHow the 49ers got here:\nSan Francisco running back Raheem Mostert\u2019s 220 yard and four touchdown performance against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship earned his team its seventh Super Bowl appearance and its first since losing to the Baltimore Ravens in 2012. The 49ers\u2019 defense forced three turnovers and held the Packers to 62 rushing yards. Packers\u2019 Aaron Rodgers was sacked three times and was held to a 22.8 quarterback rating.\nIn the Divisional Round, Bosa was dominant in the 27-10 win over the Minnesota Vikings, recording six tackles and two sacks. The 49ers limited Vikings running back Dalvin Cook to only 18 rushing yards.\nRyan McFadden is a student in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism master\u2019s degree program.

    "content": "MIAMI \u2014 San Francisco running back Raheem Mostert etched his name in the history books with his 220-yard, four-touchdown performance in the NFC Championship game to propel the 49ers to the Super Bowl.\nAmong his teammates, though, the surfing celebration he performs in the end zone already made him stand out from the crowd.\nMostert\u2019s signature celebration stems from years of riding the waves in his hometown New Smyrna Beach, Florida. He started as an avid skateboarder, then made a smooth transition into surfing by watching other riders and soliciting help from friends.\n\u201cIt was the same mechanics, and I fell in love with it,\u201d Mostert said. \u201c[Surfing] was another way for me to get away and have fun.\u201d\nNew Smyrna Beach and its surrounding county have gained a reputation as the shark-bite capital of the world, but Mostert never let that bother him. Surfing provided a needed escape from the grind of football and the turbulence of his family life.\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t doing right in school or if things weren\u2019t going [my] way, I would use it as a getaway to go to the beach and relax,\u201d Mostert said.\nThe water sport also provided a valuable lesson: Surfing requires a lot of falling and picking yourself back up. Mostert was cut by six teams in 18 months at the start of his NFL career, but he persevered and finally found a home with the 49ers in 2016.\nMostert\u2019s surfing background caught his San Francisco teammates by surprise, but it made them appreciate his athletic abilities even more.\n\u201cThe fact [he] can do that and be that good at it is unbelievable,\u201d 49ers defensive lineman Solomon Thomas said. \u201cI thought it was super cool.\u201d\nThomas and long snapper Kyle Nelson were eager to learn more about the sport. After DeForest Buckner\u2019s Hawaiian wedding in 2018, Mostert gave Thomas and Nelson a surfing lesson that made them realize it was harder than they expected.\n\u201cWhen I got on the board and started paddling, I was like, \u2018Hey, when do we start?\u2019\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI almost missed my flight because it took a while for me to paddle back in because I was so tired.\u201d\nNelson added: \u201cI\u2019m gonna say the reason we didn\u2019t get up too much is because the waves weren\u2019t very good. That\u2019s at least what he told us that to make us not feel as bad we couldn\u2019t get up on the surfboard.\u201d\nMostert won\u2019t be giving surfing lessons anytime soon, as a stipulation in his three-year contract, which was added this season, forbids him from participating in extreme sports.\nMostert\u2019s passion for surfing, though, will continue to carry on through his touchdown celebrations, a reminder of his journey from riding the waves as a teenager to playing on the world\u2019s biggest stage on Sunday night.\nRyan McFadden is a student in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism master\u2019s degree program.

    "content": "MIAMI \u2014 Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Kendall Fuller and linebacker Dorian O\u2019Daniel dreamed of playing in the NFL when they were teammates at Our Lady of Good Counsel High School in Olney, Md. In their wildest dreams, perhaps they imagined playing in the Super Bowl.\nNever did they expect to reach the pinnacle of the sport together.\n\u201cTo be on the same team never crossed our minds,\u201d said O\u2019Daniel, a second-year player from Clemson. \u201cHow often does that ever happen?\u201d\nYet here they are together, preparing to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\nA fourth-year player out of Virginia Tech, Fuller played his first two seasons for the Washington Redskins but was traded to the Chiefs in January 2018. Three months later, he was sitting at O\u2019Daniel\u2019s draft party when Kansas City selected his friend in the third round.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh wait, we\u2019re on the same team,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Daniel said. \u201cIt was dope because I FaceTimed the general manager and Kendall was with me.\u201d\nFuller and O\u2019Daniel have spent two seasons in the same NFL locker room, going up against players they either watched or looked up to in high school. Each moment they share on the field still feels like a dream.\n\u201cMost of the time after games, we just sit here and think about it,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cLike, \u2018Damn, we are really here together.\u2019\u201d\nFuller and O\u2019Daniel are like brothers, but their relationship wasn\u2019t always so cozy. The two made the Good Counsel varsity team together as freshmen, but while O\u2019Daniel had been attending summer practice sessions, Fuller joined the team just weeks before the start of the school year. When Fuller stepped onto the practice field for the first time, O\u2019Daniel thought he was going to lose his spotlight.\n\u201cI felt some type of way because here I am thinking I\u2019m that guy, then there\u2019s another freshman playing varsity,\u201d O\u2019Daniel said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Am I good enough?\u2019\u201d\nOnce the season started, though, that mindset quickly faded away. Fuller and O\u2019Daniel became a strong defensive duo that helped Good Counsel win four straight Washington Catholic Athletic Conference championships.\n\u201cGoing to a great program like Good Counsel, the target was on our back every week,\u201d O\u2019Daniel said. \u201cThat translated well for me because it taught me to bring my best foot forward and people are going to be gunning for you.\u201d\nAt the Super Bowl, Fuller and O\u2019Daniel will seek to capture the same feeling they had winning conference titles at Good Counsel.\n\u201cWe got championships in high school and we are going to try to get a championship on Sunday together,\u201d Fuller said.\nRyan McFadden is a student in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism master\u2019s degree program.

Skiing and other outdoor sports are also expected to be significantly affected, with entire communities relying on these sports facing an uncertain future.",
    "content": "If a thunderstorm had loomed over the stadium, or a downpour had erupted or a heat wave had rolled through Houston that October night, the tens of thousands of fans watching Game 7 of the World Series in Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park would have been protected by its retractable roof. \nThe park is climate controlled, one of several stadiums in the league that shield players and fans from extreme weather. As temperatures around the globe continue to rise \u2014 July was the hottest month ever recorded \u2014 experts say many other teams in Major League Baseball could be forced to adjust to climate change. And it won\u2019t be the only sport facing this problem. \nEconomists say climate change will have a profound economic impact on many sports in the coming decades. Already, leagues have shifted schedules to adapt to heat, teams are considering pricey new air-conditioned stadiums, and entire communities that rely on sports revenue face an uncertain future. \nWhile most sports will be affected in some way, experts say a few \u2014 such as baseball, soccer and skiing \u2014 will be hit harder than others. \nPostponements, domes and empty seats\nBaseball, with its 162-game season \u2014 played mostly in outdoor stadiums \u2014 is easily upset by changes in weather. \nWhile football and soccer teams can play through rainy spells, these conditions make a baseball game nearly impossible. Pitchers can easily lose their grip on the ball, puddles collect on the infield and players can slip and hurt themselves. \n\u201cBaseball is more vulnerable to weather delays\u2026because you literally can\u2019t play baseball in the rain. It\u2019s not safe,\u201d David Berri, economics professor at Southern Utah University, said. \nThe league saw its highest number of postponements in nearly three decades in 2018 \u2014 with 54 games affected by weather. 2019 saw fewer events. \n\u201cIf you have more frequent rain delays, you\u2019re imposing additional costs on the owner,\u201d said Berri, citing salaries for the original game\u2019s crew, reimbursements for fans\u2019 tickets and the expense of a rescheduled game. \nBrad Humphreys, professor of economics at West Virginia University, said as teams encounter difficulties caused by climate change, they might resort to climate controlled stadiums \u2014 if they can find a way to pay for them. The structures can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\u201cIf \u2026 climate change is affecting their ability to practice or their ability to sell tickets, then they might need to replace outdoor facilities with domed facilities or with a retractable roof, and those things are really expensive,\u201d Humphreys said. \nThe Texas Rangers are ditching their stadium for an air-conditioned model with a retractable roof, a concession to the punishing Texas heat that costs more than $300 million. They join the Astros, which have been playing in air conditioning for more than 50 years. \nWhile these stadiums protect fans and players from heat, they\u2019re often damaged by other forms of extreme weather. The Miami Marlins\u2019 stadium took a beating when Hurricane Irma stripped it of some of its rough outer membrane, warranting a replacement of that layer. \nExperts say climate change could be one of the reasons \u2013 but certainly not the sole one \u2013 that baseball has seen attendance dwindle over the last decade. \nWhile the die-hard fan might show up to a game when it\u2019s over 100 degrees, Humphreys said some fans would choose the comfort of their couch over baking outside in the stands for hours. \n\u201cPeople might just say forget about it. I\u2019m not going to a baseball game. It\u2019s 105 degrees,\u201d Humphreys said. \nConsidering how it requires favorable weather conditions, and because cancellations are costly, economist Andrew Zimbalist said, \u201cin the United States, probably baseball is the most vulnerable,\u201d to climate change.  \nMajor League Baseball declined to comment for this story. \nA costly schedule change\nThe soccer world took an economic walloping when the Qatar World Cup was moved from June to November 2022, upsetting schedules of many teams and imposing rescheduling costs on owners.\nThe move came after a FIFA evaluation cited high temperatures to be health concerns for fans and players. \n\u201cThe fact that the competition is planned in June/July, the two hottest months of the year in this region, has to be considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken,\u201d the report read. \nThe move has forced other leagues to change their schedules in order to send players during their typical peak practice and playing times. \nThe schedule change came \u201cmuch to the chagrin of all of the soccer leagues in the world who don\u2019t want to have to release their best players right during the middle of their season,\u201d said Victor Matheson, economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross.\nThe economic effects of this decision rippled far from Qatar. \nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge, former chairman of the European Club Association, released a statement saying: \u201cThe European clubs and leagues cannot be expected to bear the costs for such rescheduling. We expect the clubs to be compensated for the damage that a final decision would cause.\u201d\nThough it already pays clubs to send their players to the event, FIFA set aside $209 million \u2014 an increase from past years \u2014  for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to cover the costs for the European Club Association.\nHumphreys wonders if the Qatar schedule shift is just the start.  \n\u201cI mean, what if it\u2019s not just Qatar? What if [it] becomes difficult to hold World Cups in the summer just because of climate change?\u201d Humphreys asked. \u201cIf they hold it somewhere and it turns out to be much too hot to feel they have to move the entire World Cup to the fall when it\u2019s cooler, that could continue to be disruptive to the European leagues.\u201d\nFIFA is taking note of the heat, introducing water breaks for the first time during the 2014 Brazil World Cup. They have also created a policy for optional cooling breaks starting in 2014.\nTeams have still run into issues, though. In June, a Nigerian player collapsed during a practice the night before African Cup of Nations\u2019 first game. His illness was later attributed to severe dehydration. \n\u201cFIFA regularly monitors this matter, maintaining constant contact with current and on-going studies and reviewing our protocols, with a view to finding solutions that are applicable across the global football community,\u201d a FIFA spokesperson said. \nCommunities on the line\nRising temperatures haven\u2019t caused issues just for over-100-degree baseball fields or soccer pitches. They\u2019re also wreaking havoc on snowy \u2014 or rather, snow-deprived \u2014 skiing slopes.  \nMatheson argues downhill skiing \u201cis by far the No. 1\u201d sport that will be economically hit by climate change, because unlike other sports that can shift seasons or locations, a ski resort can\u2019t be lifted to a more favorable location. If it doesn\u2019t have enough snow for that season, he said, it\u2019s out of luck.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a big old ski resort, you have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in your facility. Your local town has all built up around the availability of skiing here and you just can\u2019t up and move that 200 miles north for cooler weather and better snow,\u201d Matheson said. \nIt\u2019s a concern in the industry, after a ski industry expert reported in 2015 that 31 percent of ski resorts are in danger of closing. One of the reasons behind this is a lack of snow.\nA study in Geographical Research Letters, a scientific journal, showed that average snowfall has fallen 41 percent for the western United States since 1998, significantly shortening the skiing season. Many hills are leaning on snow machines as a strategy to lengthen their seasons. \nIt\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re going to great lengths to get patrons to show. \nSkiing is more connected to the economic fabric of a community than football, soccer or baseball, Matheson said. Home values in areas near ski resorts could experience at least 15 percent drop in value by 2050, according to one study. \nThe cost of climate change\nWhile climate change is undoubtedly going to affect sports around the world, it shouldn\u2019t be the reason we\u2019re worried about it, Berri said.  \n\u201cIt seems rather silly that you may have to tell people that global warming is important because it might affect rainouts at a baseball game,\u201d Berri said.\n\u201cSo you say, \u2018Ok, global warming may result in the deaths of millions of people around the world,\u2019 \u201d and, Berri said, people might not respond passionately. But he said if you add to it that climate change \u201calso might lead to more rainouts for the Orioles. Okay, now you get a problem.\u201d\nResearchers  said the economic impact of climate change on sports isn\u2019t being widely studied in the field or discussed among sports owners. Berri says the most effective way to raise interest in this issue is to show owners how and why they\u2019ll lose money. \n \u201cIf you could document that this is going to be a cost in the future? Yes\u2026,\u201d Berri said, \u201cthe people who are directly affected and have costs imposed upon them take this very seriously.\u201d",

    "summary": "NCAA rules allow colleges to report either actual or distributed ticket numbers as attendance, leading to inflated figures; Maryland, for example, reported a 56.3% difference between announced and scanned attendance in 2018. This discrepancy is common across the Big Ten, masking declining actual attendance at games.",
    "content": "Fifteen minutes before Maryland football\u2019s Big Ten Conference bout with Illinois on Oct. 27, 2018, the vast pockets of space in the bleachers were apparent.\nFor a game that prompted more than 24,000 tickets to be sold, fewer than 11,000 were scanned into Maryland Stadium. But you wouldn\u2019t know it when an announced attendance of 30,387 flashed on the scoreboard late in the second half.\n\nThere\u2019s about 15 minutes until kickoff. pic.twitter.com/OsxOsK70le\n\u2014 Andy Kostka (@afkostka) October 27, 2018\n\nThe NCAA allows for announced attendance figures to be generated in two ways: either through actual attendance (tickets scanned) or through tickets distributed (tickets sold and complimentary tickets).\nMatt Monroe, Maryland\u2019s associate athletic director for ticket operations, called it \u201ccommon practice\u201d for programs to use the latter method. And that has allowed schools like Maryland to report totals that are far higher than actuality, even as scanned attendance numbers in college football continue to dip.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know of many places that would announce their actual numbers. Just because if a ticket is paid for, it\u2019s distributed,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cYou count that into your revenue, you count that into your season ticket totals and your totals for the game.\u201d\nAccording to ticket data obtained through records requests from nine of the 14 Big Ten schools \u2014 Maryland, Rutgers, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio State, Minnesota and Nebraska \u2014 each program saw its average scanned attendance at home fall from 2017 to 2018 and seven saw drops from 2016 to 2017. The other five schools either did not respond to requests for data or declined to provide data.\nThe announced attendance figure helps mask those widespread problems.\nMaryland, currently with a 3-6 record in 2019, has finished with losing football records each of the past four years, and had a 56.3 percent difference between announced attendance and scanned attendance in 2018. That was the second highest rate among the nine schools that provided data.\n\nAnd getting fans to attend the games they purchase tickets for has been a problem, too. Among the seven schools that provided complete ticket data (Nebraska did not have 2018 tickets sold totals and Rutgers did not provide ticket scan totals), Maryland finished last in percentage of sold tickets in 2018 that were scanned into home games.\n\nThe Big Ten\u2019s blue bloods have little trouble packing their stadiums, with Michigan, Ohio State and Nebraska all filling more than 80 percent of total stadium capacity last year based on scanned ticket totals.\nMeanwhile, teams like Maryland, Rutgers and Illinois have placed at or near the bottom of the Big Ten standings in recent years, and the stadiums at those schools were each less than 40 percent full through the 2018 season.\nMaryland was again last among the nine teams.\n\nBy announced attendance figures, though, Maryland appeared to fill 64.9 percent of maximum stadium capacity in 2018. Rutgers did so at a 71.2 percent clip, and Illinois clocked in at 59.6 percent.\nFor each home game, Maryland utilizes an audit system that helps generate an announced attendance figure, factoring in entities such as the marching band into the final number, according to Monroe.\nIn 2018, Maryland averaged about a 4,500 person difference between announced attendance and tickets sold for each home game. That disparity is made up of the distributed complimentary tickets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always done that here. It\u2019s not something that we just came up with,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cSo in order to be consistent in what we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve always just done it that way. And again, I think it\u2019s common practice.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal dataset of 96 schools\u2019 ticket and attendance numbers from 2017, only the United States Naval Academy used its scanned attendance as its announced figure.\nThe NCAA attendance guidelines also help smaller schools stay afloat in the college football landscape.\nNCAA bylaws require institutions to average 15,000 in home attendance at least once during a rolling two-year period to maintain Football Bowl Subdivision status \u2014 the peak level of college football. While Big Ten teams have little to worry about, smaller programs take advantage of the attendance rules to reach the threshold.\nThe athletic department of Miami University (Ohio) purchased tickets in 2018 to meet the requirement, which is allowed under NCAA guidelines, according to Miami\u2019s student newspaper. Coastal Carolina University\u2019s athletic department employed a similar tactic in 2017, the program\u2019s first season in the FBS.\nSo long as the attendance rules remain flexible for college football programs, they\u2019ll continue to make the most of them to counteract declining attendance.\n\u201cWith football, a lot of it has to do with things like weather and people\u2019s schedules,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cThose are things that are out of our control.\u201d",

    "summary": "In 2019, Major League Baseball shattered its single-season home run record with 6,776 homers, with many teams setting or tying their own franchise records. Theories about the surge include changes in pitching and hitting strategies, as well as speculation that the baseballs themselves had been altered.",
    "content": "As quickly as Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Caleb Ferguson unleashed a fastball meant to hit the back of catcher Austin Barnes\u2019 mitt, his pitch was even more swiftly sent into the left-field bleachers.\nFor Baltimore Orioles second baseman Jonathan Villar, it was merely the 21st longball of his season. But for Major League Baseball as a whole, it was far more significant. Villar had hit MLB\u2019s 6,106th home run in 2019, breaking the previous season record with weeks to spare.\nWith the regular season now over, a majority of baseball\u2019s 30 teams teams had top-five seasons in franchise history by home run totals \u2014 with nearly half of them either breaking or tying their respective franchise records during the 6,776-homer season.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins, who led MLB with 307 blasts, comfortably breezed past their previous record of 225 home runs set in 1963. By Aug. 31, they had already hit more home runs than any team in history to that point (268). In fact, four teams \u2014 the Twins, the New York Yankees (306), the Houston Astros (288) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (279) \u2014 surpassed that number long before the season concluded Sunday.\nThe cause of the massive increase? No one knows for sure.\nBoston Red Sox designated hitter J.D. Martinez, who led the team with 36 home runs in 2019, told reporters in July that hitters are more equipped to deal with the increase of power-focused pitchers. Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander \u2014 a 15-year veteran who allowed a career-high 36 home runs in 2019 \u2014 theorized that the balls had been altered to generate more offense.\nAfter 127 years without a 5,000-home run season, MLB saw nine-straight such seasons from 1998 to 2006. That period, part of what is known as the \u201cthe steroid era,\u201d was marred by the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\nAfter a crackdown on performance-enhancers, including performance-enhancing drug testing starting in the 2003 season for rostered players, there was a lull in home runs from 2007 to 2015. Teams combined for 5,000 longballs just once in those nine years.\n\nBut the hot bats have returned, and at least 5,500 home runs were hit in each of the past four seasons, with 2019 topping the previous record of 6,105 set in 2017. And this season, every team either matched or topped their home run totals from 2018.\nStill, some teams lagged behind the pack.\nThe Miami Marlins closed their 2019 campaign with a meager .352 winning percentage, and their home runs (or lack thereof) match up. The Marlins finished last in home run total, joining the Detroit Tigers \u2014 who owned MLB\u2019s worst record \u2014 as the only squads to average less than one home run per game in 2019. Last year, there were six such teams \u2014 with the Marlins at the bottom.\n\nThe Tigers, meanwhile, had the 49th best season in their franchise\u2019s history by home run count and finished the season as the only team to not have a player with at least 20 home runs this season.\nBut while a handful of teams haven\u2019t found the same success as the majority, the point stands: balls are leaving the park at absurdly high rates.\nThe league averaged 1.39 home runs per game in the 2019 regular season, by far the highest rate in MLB history. The previous high was 1.25 home runs per game, set in 2017.\n\u201cI think hitters are more prepared than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Martinez told reporters during the All-Star break. \u201cI think pitchers now, it\u2019s a power-arm league. It\u2019s either a walk or a strikeout, stuff over command. So I think you see a lot more mistakes over the plate. The velocity and the guys trying to hit balls in the air \u2014 it\u2019s like a recipe for a home run.\u201d\nAnd as the season progressed, players\u2019 bats got hotter. In March, the league averaged 1.24 home runs per game. That figure jumped to 1.32 in April, 1.37 in May, 1.41 in June, 1.44 in July and 1.48 in August. September \u2014 when MLB rosters expand to 40 players, creating more bullpen matchup opportunities and giving less-experienced hitters opportunities at the plate \u2014 saw a decline at 1.36.\nA new wave of players has been at the forefront of that hot-hitting trend.\nAmong the top 10 players in home runs during the regular season, nine are 30 years old or younger. Three have yet to see their 25th birthday. And sitting at the top is 24-year-old rookie Pete Alonso of the New York Mets, snapping the rookie record with 53 home runs.\n\nOn the flip side, pitching staffs have suffered through the home run surge. One day after Villar hit the record-setting home run, the Orioles surrendered two longballs to break the mark for most home runs allowed by a team in a single season. By the season\u2019s end, the Orioles gave up 305 home runs \u2014 shattering the Cincinnati Reds\u2019 record of 258 set in 2016.\n\u201cWe all know what happened. [MLB commissioner Rob] Manfred the first time he came in, what\u2019d he say? He said we want more offense,\u201d Verlander told ESPN in July. \u201cAll of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced? It\u2019s not coincidence. We\u2019re not idiots.\u201d\nIn May, Manfred was presented a report, per The Associated Press, that said the balls had less drag on them, resulting in increased home run numbers. He denies that the league has tampered with baseballs to achieve those results.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The physicality picked up in Game 3 of the Washington Capitals first-round series against the Hurricanes in Carolina on Monday.\nThe defending NHL champion Capitals lost the game 5-0, but still lead the series 2-1. And the Hurricanes lost a key player.\nThe Capitals\u2019 physicality was encapsulated in a fight in the first period.\nShortly after winger Warren Foegele scored to give Carolina a 1-0 lead, Capitals star winger and captain Alex Ovechkin exchanged slashes with Hurricanes winger Andrei Svechnikov. Both agreed to drop the gloves.\nOvechkin landed consecutive crushing right hands and dropped Svechnikov, who hit his head on the ice when he fell. Svechnikov stayed down on the ice for several minutes and appeared very woozy. He eventually left the ice without a stretcher but needed assistance to gingerly skate to the locker room.\n\u201cThe game doesn\u2019t really matter when something like that happens,\u201d Hurricanes defenseman Dougie Hamilton said after the game. \u201cYou just can\u2019t get it out of your head. I just hope he\u2019s OK.\u201d\nOvechkin also showed concern for Svechnikov, who is in concussion protocol and isn\u2019t expected to be available for Thursday\u2019s game.\n\u201cFirst of all, I hope he\u2019s OK,\u201d Ovechkin told reporters after the game. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fighter and he\u2019s the same way. He asked me to fight and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\nCarolina\u2019s coach, Rod Brind\u2019Amour, was not happy with Ovechkin and said he shouldn\u2019t have fought Svechnikov.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s words exchanged, but one guy\u2019s gloves comes off way first and that\u2019s Ovi\u2019s, it\u2019s not our guy\u2019s,\u201d Brind\u2019Amour told reporters after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit frustrating because he got hurt and it\u2019s his first fight. He\u2019s played 90 games, he\u2019s never fought in his life and I\u2019m pretty sure Ovi knew that. That stuff bothers me, but it\u2019s done.\u201d\nVideo appears to show both players agreeing to drop the gloves and Svechnikov threw some punches before Ovechkin landed the knockout blow.\nIt was Svechnikov\u2019s first fight in the NHL (he had one as a junior player) and Ovechkin\u2019s first fight since 2010. Svechnikov is listed at 195 pounds, while Ovechkin is listed at 235 pounds on Hockey-Reference.\nSvechnikov, the second pick in last year\u2019s draft, hasn\u2019t missed any games yet this season and the 19-year-old scored 20 goals in the regular season. He already scored 2 goals and added an assist in the playoff series before the fight.\nEarlier in the series, Svechnikov told NBC Sports that he looked up to Ovechkin and grew up idolizing him. Both players are Russian.\nThe Hurricanes rallied behind their injured player after the fight and dominated the Capitals in the game, out-shooting them 45-18 on their way to the 5-0 victory.\nHurricanes forward and captain Justin Williams called the atmosphere in the arena \u201cabsolutely electric\u201d after the game.\nThe Capitals struggled to get any momentum going and leaders ripped the team\u2019s performance.\n\u201cI\u2019d say they had a little bit more desperation level than we had going into (the game), so we didn\u2019t deserve to win,\u201d Capitals coach Todd Reirden said in his postgame press conference.\n\u201cWe just stopped playing,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWe can\u2019t play like that if we want to win. We\u2019re better than that.\u201d\nThe Capitals will have their shot at redemption and control of the series Thursday night in Carolina. A win would push Carolina to the brink of elimination and give the Caps a 3-1 cushion in the best-of-seven series. A loss would level the series and put the pressure on the Caps to bounce back at home in Game 5.",

    "summary": "Washington Nationals bounced back from shortstop Trea Turner's season-ending finger injury with a dramatic 9-8 walk-off win against the Phillies, followed by a shutout victory over the Mets. Despite the significant loss, the team showed resilience and acknowledged Turner\u2019s importance to their lineup.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Despite having only played six games, the Washington Nationals were already facing adversity on Tuesday when shortstop Trea Turner suffered a broken finger as Bryce Harper returned to the nation\u2019s capital with the Phillies and helped crush his former team.\nThe Nationals fell to 2-4 and ace Max Scherzer dropped to 0-2. But the team bounced back Wednesday with a 9-8 come-from-behind walk-off win over the Phillies, followed Thursday by a shutout victory over the Mets.\nManger Dave Martinez challenged his team after Turner\u2019s injury and the players responded with victories, showing signs that they could power through the loss of their shortstop.\n\u201cWe had the walk-off the other day with Trea and now this one,\u201d said utility man Jake Noll after his game-ending walk that scored a run Wednesday.\nEven after beating their division rivals, the Nationals spoke about how important Turner is to the team.\n\u201cAnytime you lose your starting shortstop for an extended period of time, especially a player as talented as Trea, it\u2019s tough to swallow,\u201d Ryan Zimmerman, the Nationals first baseman told the Washington Post after the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big loss,\u201d said Martinez in his postgame press conference.\nThe Nationals have not yet announced a timetable for Turner\u2019s return but he is expected to miss significant time and has already been placed on the injured list (IL).\nBefore being sidelined, Turner already had hit a walk-off home run for the Nationals and led the league with four stolen bases. He played every game last season, hitting 19 homers, knocking in 73 runs, scoring 103 runs, and leading the National League with 43 stolen bases.\nTurner was not happy with the pitch that injured him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect somebody to basically throw at my head,\u201d Turner said after the game, while explaining why he wasn\u2019t able to avoid getting hit.\nMartinez sounded sullen at his press conference.\n\u201cThe ball was in and he just couldn\u2019t get out of the way,\u201d Martinez said.\nTurner\u2019s injury took some of the spotlight off of star pitcher Stephen Strasburg. Many analysts were concerned that Strasburg\u2019s fastball, which is known for reaching 100 mph, topped out at approximately 94 mph in a loss to the Mets in his first start of the season.\nStrasburg got a second chance against the Mets in his second start of the season and eased those concerns by shutting the Mets down.\n\u201cIf your strengths are their strengths, you kind of have to go mano a mano,\u201d Strasburg told the Washington Post after the victory.\nThe strategy paid off as he allowed just three hits and one walk while striking out nine over 6.2 innings in the 4-0 victory.\nThe Nationals also finally received some good news regarding other injuries. Utility man Howie Kendrick has been activated from the IL after missing the start of the season with a hamstring injury.\nLast season, Kendrick batted .303 in 40 games with the Nationals and provided versatility by playing first base, second base, left field and right field. The Nationals optioned Noll to the minors when they activated Kendrick.\nPatrick Corbin is expected to start the next Nationals game against the Mets in New York on Saturday.\nThe 29-year-old lefty signed a six-year, $140 million deal over the offseason. He spent the first six seasons of his career with the Arizona Diamondbacks and has 56-54 career record with a 3.91 ERA.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to join this ball club and be a part of something special,\u201d said Corbin at his introductory press conference.\nCorbin is looking for his first win with the Nationals after getting a no-decision in his first start with them.",

The Giants were disappointed to lose him, while Washington hopes he will help improve their struggling team's performance.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Washington\u2019s NFL team recently made a big move in free agency, signing safety Landon Collins to a six-year, $84 million contract.\nCollins, 25, had already made the Pro Bowl three times and was a member of the AP All-Pro team in 2016, all with the New York Giants, a division rival.\n\u201cThat organization is awesome,\u201d Collins said in an interview with NFL Network about his former team. \u201cHonestly I love them. I respect them, they gave me my first opportunity to play in the NFL, they took a chance on my and hopefully they love the four years I gave them.\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds with the New York Giants but I\u2019m glad it happened because now I\u2019m in that burgundy and gold.\u201d\nThe Giants decided not to give Collins a big contract, but ownership was still disappointed to lose him.\n\u201cThat hurt me greatly,\u201d John Mara, the president and co-owner of the Giants, said at the 2019 NFL owners\u2019 meetings in Phoenix. \u201cI liked Landon a lot, and I had a great deal of respect for him. He played hard week in and week out.\u201d\nThe Washington franchise hopes Collins can be among the off-season upgrades that will get the struggling team back into the playoffs.\nCollins has been widely regarded in football, going back to his high school days. He was a 5-star recruit going into college after starring in football and as a sprinter at Dutchtown High School in Louisiana.\nAfter high school, he made the decision to attend the University of Alabama over Louisiana State University live on ESPN \u2013 to the dismay of his mother, who sat next to him, shook her head and said she still supported LSU.\nCollins backed that decision up by helping Alabama win the national title his freshman season.\nAfter three seasons at Alabama, Collins declared for the NFL draft and was selected by the Giants with the first pick of the second round.\nAnalyst Lance Zierlein called Collins a \u201cwrap-up tackler. Physical enough to match up against tight ends and has the feet to carry big, slot targets,\u201d but went on to criticize Collins\u2019 ability to cover receivers and tight ends. Those continue to be the biggest knocks on Collins.\nDespite his success in the NFL, he still has had issues in coverage.\nHe switched from his natural position \u2013 strong safety \u2013 to free safety during his rookie season due to injuries suffered by other defensive backs. Collins struggled in coverage at free safety but did have an interception and more than 100 tackles.\nCollins moved back to strong safety in 2016 and broke out with five interceptions and four sacks. He also played well in the Giants\u2019 playoff loss that season, coming up with a sack and six tackles.\nThe Giants failed to make the playoffs over the past two seasons and Collins missed five games due to a broken forearm in 2017 and a torn rotator cuff in 2018.\n(new graf) Despite the injuries, he made the Pro Bowl both seasons. He is not expected to miss any time next season because of the rotator cuff injury.\nOne thing Collins will change with his new team is his jersey number. With the Giants, Collins wore 21 to honor Sean Taylor, a star free safety for Washington, who was tragically killed at 24 during a 2007 home invasion.\nNow that he\u2019s going to play for Washington, Collins will wear number 20 instead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always dreamed of being at because of my favorite player,\u201d Collins said at his introductory press conference on March 14.\nCollins was given a game-worn Taylor jersey by Redskins owner Dan Snyder.\n\u201cI instantly broke down,\u201d Collins said. \u201cInstantly broke down into tears.\u201d\nWashington coach Jay Gruden said that, aside from the feel-good part of Collins joining the team, he expects a lot of the veteran.\n\u201cWe expect unbelievable things from him because he\u2019s the highest- paid safety in the NFL, so he better be the best one,\u201d Gruden said at the 2019 NFL owners\u2019 meetings in Phoenix.\nCollins didn\u2019t back down from the expectations and said he was excited to join linebacker Ryan Anderson and defensive end Jonathan Allen, who Collins played with at Alabama.\n\u201cWe know how each other plays and how we get after it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe know what it takes to win, and all we want to do is win.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Wizards picked up an important 100-90 victory over the Orlando Magic Wednesday night, leaving them 3-and-a-half games back of the Miami Heat for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\nDespite having the eighth-worst record in the NBA, the Wizards still have an opportunity to make the playoffs, especially after beating the Magic, one of three teams they need to pass in order to get in.\nThe Wizards also have one game against the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat remaining. The Hornets and Heat are the other two teams ahead of the Wizards for the eighth seed.\nAs usual, shooting guard Bradley Beal, the Wizards leading scorer, led the way with a team-high 23 points and added seven assists, but Beal praised his teammates after the game.\n\u201cOne of the biggest areas of my game that I\u2019ve grown in is just trusting your teammates to be able to make plays,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to make every play, and especially with John (Wall) being out, and the way our team is\u2026 You have to be able to trust your teammates\u2019 abilities to be able to help and contribute.\u201d\nThe Wizards got many of those contributions off the bench Wednesday. They got 59 points from players who came off the bench, while on the season they average 38 points from bench players per game.\n\u201cI felt like I was playing horrible the last couple games and I obviously saw it in myself and I know Coach (Scott) Brooks saw it,\u201d said center Thomas Bryant, who had 21 points and 10 rebounds off the bench on Wednesday. \u201cI just wanted to see what I could clear up and try to help the team out and help myself out.\u201d\nBryant has taken advantage of increased playing time due to starting center Dwight Howard\u2019s back injury, which has caused him to miss almost the entire season.\nBryant has averaged 9.8 points and 5.7 rebounds per game so far this season. He played sparingly for the Los Angeles Lakers last season, averaging 1.5 points and 1.1 rebound per game.\nSmall forward Jabari Parker is another key player who comes off the bench for the Wizards. He was acquired at the trade deadline from the Chicago Bulls along with power forward Bobby Portis in exchange for small forward Otto Porter.\nSince the trade, Parker has averaged 13.9 points per game and has been very efficient with a .563 field goal percentage. His field goal percentage was .474 in his time with the Bulls this season.\nParker continued that trend making 9 of 12 shots against the Magic, scoring 19 points.\n\u201cGrowth is exciting for me and I want to keep getting better,\u201d Parker said after the win. He also spoke about the importance of remaining unselfish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so difficult for my game to play with others,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI always want to make it easy for my teammates if I\u2019m trying to draw attention and (pass) to guys, so it\u2019s really just trying to get that type of energy day in and day out.\u201d\nUnselfish play and bench production will be crucial if the Wizards are going to sneak into the playoffs.\n\u201cI think right now it\u2019s our backs against the wall and how are we going to respond,\u201d said point guard Chasson Randle, who scored 13 points off the bench. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot of energy right now and as long as we do the little things and play for each other, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nIf the Wizards are going to make a run, it has to be now, and the team has given fans reasons to stay hopeful, winning four of its last six.\n\u201cIt feels good to play meaningful basketball, and on the bright side, we\u2019re still in the hunt, so we\u2019re just trying to get to (the playoffs),\u201d Parker said.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Washington\u2019s NFL team has agreed to a trade with the Denver Broncos for quarterback Case Keenum, who has one year remaining on his contract.\nWashington will send a sixth-round pick in the 2020 draft and receive a 2020 seventh-round pick, said ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter on Thursday.\nThe league year begins on March 13, so the trade cannot be officially processed until then.\nKeenum is in the second year of a two-year, $36 million deal, though his contract will be reworked for the trade, and Washington is expected to pay Keenum $3.5 million for the upcoming season.\nWhile the trade doesn\u2019t involve much risk, many analysts have blasted Washington for not making a bigger move.\nWashington Post Columnist Jerry Brewer called Keenum an \u201cokay stopgap,\u201d and added that the team continues to \u201cperpetuate mediocrity.\u201d\nThe Broncos were looking to trade Keenum after they agreed to a trade for quarterback Joe Flacco earlier in the offseason.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely disappointed, it\u2019s not something we wanted to happen,\u201d Keenum said on ESPN after learning the Broncos had traded for Flacco.\nKeenum was supposed to provide the Broncos with short-term relief but that didn\u2019t happen, said Denver Post reporter Ryan O\u2019Halloran, who added that the move would help Denver, saving $14.5 million from the team\u2019s salary cap.\nKeenum had a breakthrough season with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017, throwing 22 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also led the Vikings to a playoff victory, but struggled with Denver last season, throwing 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. Denver ended the season with a 6-10 record.\nThe trade leaves Washington with three quarterbacks. Starter Alex Smith suffered a compound fracture in his leg last season. He also dealt with infections following the injury and needed multiple surgeries for infections in addition to surgery for the initial injury.\nWashington has not announced whether or not there is a possibility Smith will play next season.\n\u201cThis is an injury that\u2019s tough to overcome, but you also don\u2019t know Alex and what he can do with his mind and what he can overcome,\u201d Jay Gruden, Washington\u2019s coach, said on ESPN. \u201cWill he be ready next year or the year after? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll play it by ear.\u201d\nLast season was the first of a four-year, $94 million contract for Smith, after Washington signed him to replace quarterback Kirk Cousins, who signed with Minnesota after serving as Washington\u2019s starter for three consecutive seasons.\nThe other quarterback on Washington\u2019s roster is Colt McCoy, who also broke his leg last season. His injury was less severe than Smith\u2019s and he has recovered from it.\nMcCoy has spent the majority of his career as a backup and has thrown 29 touchdowns but also has 26 interceptions. He is signed for one more season.\nMcCoy has only started in 27 games in nine seasons since being drafted but has dealt with many injuries, including missing time for a neck injury in 2014 and a concussion in 2011.\nAfter Smith\u2019s injury, Washington went on to start three different quarterbacks over the team\u2019s final six games. If Smith is unable to play next season, Washington\u2019s quarterback situation remains murky, and Keenum could end up going into the season as their starter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic, if anyone can come back it\u2019s Alex\u2026we\u2019ll see,\u201d Washington\u2019s team president, Bruce Allen, told NBC Sports.",

It also bodes well for the Capitals that they have 13 goals in their last two games and none were scored by the league\u2019s leading goal scorer, Alexander Ovechkin.\nDespite the dominant victory over Ottawa, the Capitals got off to a slow start and fell behind 2-0 in the first period. They rallied to tie the game with two goals late in the first period and then carried that momentum into the second period.\nThey dominated play in the second and scored four goals in the first eleven minutes of the period.\n\u201cObviously a tough start and about halfway through the (first) period we started to realize that we needed to play at a little bit different level, and a little different compete than we started with,\u201d said head coach Todd Reirden. \u201cOur leadership group is strong and I think they did a good job of pulling everyone into the fight.\u201d\nThe Capitals were looking for more secondary scoring after waiving Devante Smith-Pelly, who scored seven goals for them in the playoffs last season.

It was Carlson\u2019s 10th of the season, the most of any defenseman on the Capitals.\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re just trying to take (Ovechkin) away as best they can (on power plays) and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a good job of it this year, but getting one (goal) tonight was nice, and when they\u2019re going to play like that, that\u2019s pretty much the only good look you\u2019re going to get,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cI\u2019ve got to make the most out of it when teams do that.\u201d\nTwo of the players held off the scoresheet over the last two games were Hagelin and Jensen.

He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Pittsburgh Penguins and made a run to the Stanley Cup with the New York Rangers.\nHagelin also has 22 goals and 25 assists in 121 playoff games.\nMany of the Capitals players should be familiar with Hagelin, as he has played against them in six playoff series. Hagelin\u2019s former team beat the Capitals in five of those six series.\n\u201cDefinitely there\u2019s familiarity there and they should know what they\u2019re getting,\u201d said Hagelin, who was traded by the Los Angeles Kings. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be back here.

He\u2019s a player that for us in particular adds speed, adds forward depth, and the penalty killing has been something that we\u2019ve been trying to improve all year.\u201d\nHagelin and Jensen have both been with the Capitals for less than a week so far but time will tell if Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan made the right moves at the deadline for the Capitals to repeat as champions.",

She immediately began walking around the rink taking notes.\n\u201cThose are the best leaders,\u201d Gunty said. \u201cWhatever we accomplished today is old news. How do we keep making it better. How do you keep moving forward?\u201d\nRemick\u2019s sharp eye for entrepreneurial opportunities was honed at ESPN, where she served in four different executive positions for 12 years before leaving in 2016.\n\u201cYou could say, \u2018You know what would be cool \u2014 if we did this?\u2019 and two weeks later it would be on the air. That does not happen pretty much anywhere,\u201d she said.\nWorking at the popular sports network came with its share of struggles, though. \u201cIt is a testosterone-filled environment that makes it twice as hard for a woman to be heard and to be accepted,\u201d she said of ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to act like a guy, but you have to know your stuff.\u201d\nSince joining the Black Bears, Remick has faced similar challenges \u2014 like being mistaken for Gunty\u2019s wife, something she brushed off as being \u201cpart of what happens when you are a female president of the company.\u201d\nThese kinds of interactions seem to not bother her and have never hindered her \u201cneed to succeed\u201d as she put it. Whether it was working three jobs to graduate with a degree in journalism from the University of Maryland in 1983 or selling MTV packages to pious Mississippians who called the channel a \u201cforce of evil,\u201d she never took no for an answer. Remick sees herself as an example for the next generation of sports executives, regardless of their gender.\nGunty, who owns more than 20 companies, many of which have female executives, said, \u201cI just go for the best person, whoever that is. I hope that there comes a time in our country when everybody looks at it like that.\u201d\nRemick says she has had to recalibrate her expectations somewhat. She had a staff of 30 or more at ESPN \u2014 now she oversees three people. Before a recent game, Remick and an intern ventured out into several inches of snow to post yard signs.\n\u201cIt had to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t call in my people to do that.\u201d\nThough she may not have the same budget, Remick still has grand plans, like installing a center-ice scoreboard and hosting a military appreciation night to both keep fans coming back and represent the community that sits in the shadow of Fort Meade.\n\u201cWe want the team to reflect this area and that\u2019s service to country, service to each other,\u201d she said. That includes the Black Bears players. \u201cWe want every player who comes into this organization to leave here better than we got them. And that\u2019s more than on the ice. I want them to be better men.\u201d",

He led the team to at least one playoff victory during each of his first five seasons in the NFL, and became the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games. \nFlacco went on to have one of the best postseason quarterback stretches of all-time during the 2012 playoffs, throwing for an NFL-record 11 touchdowns in the postseason, which culminated with the Ravens hoisting the Lombardi Trophy as Super Bowl Champions. Flacco earned Super Bowl MVP honors.\nAfter that historic postseason, Flacco signed a six-year contract that at the time made him the highest paid player in NFL history. Since that deal, the team\u2019s success has been less than ideal, with the Ravens only making it to the playoffs once over the next five seasons.\nDuring the 2018 NFL Draft, the Ravens used their first-round selection on former Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, hinting that the team was planning to go in a different direction at the position in the future. \nWhile Flacco began the season as Baltimore\u2019s starting quarterback, he injured his hip midway through the season, paving the way for Jackson.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Capitals overcame controversial calls and a high hit that briefly forced center Evgeny Kuznetsov to leave the game to beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-3 in overtime on Thursday.\nIt was the Capitals\u2019 third win in four games after the All-Star break. They had lost seven consecutive games going into the break, so the turnaround may be a sign that the reigning NHL champs are solving their problems in time for another bid for the Stanley Cup.\n\u201cThere was some adversity and some tough things that didn\u2019t go our way but we stuck with it and ended up getting rewarded at the end of the game,\u201d said head coach Todd Reirden.\nNicklas Backstrom appeared to score a goal in the first period but it was waived off after the referees concluded they had blown the whistle before the puck went into the net, even though the puck was still loose in the crease.\nEarly in the second period, backup goalie Pheonix Copley let in a goal from a bad angle but the Capitals challenged the play as offside. Even though replays appeared to show the play was offside, the call on the ice stood and the Capitals were assessed a penalty for losing the challenge. They managed to kill the penalty and keep the game tied.\nCopley let in another goal from a bad angle, allowing the Avalanche to tie the game with 2:07 remaining in the third period. He bounced back, making some clutch saves in overtime, including a game-saving stop off a one-timer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably one that Pheonix (Copley) would like to have back, but it\u2019s a team game,\u201d said Reirden. \u201cI loved how our team rallied behind it. We just kept going. That\u2019s a sign of a veteran team that deals with adversity and pushes forward.\u201d\nCopley agreed and praised his teammates for still finding a way to win the game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to make those saves,\u201d said Copley. \u201cA late goal like that and the guys still battle and finish it, so it\u2019s a great character win for us.\u201d\nThe Capitals came into the game looking for role players to contribute and they got that from winger Andre Burakovsky, who got the Caps on the board in the first period.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do the best I can every game whoever coach is putting me out there,\u201d said Burakovsky. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about how you have to deserve your ice time and I think I\u2019ve been battling.\u201d\nThe Capitals also got a goal from a defenseman when Matt Niskanen buried a shot off a rebound early in the third period.\nDespite the win, Niskanen was frustrated that the Avalanche were able to score late and tie the game.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty good with that over the last couple of years but lately a few have slipped away, so we\u2019ll address it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been defending better and the offense is starting to come again,\u201d said Niskanen. \u201cIt seems to me that our structure is fine. We just need to be a little more desperate as the clock is winding down.\u201d\nDespite allowing a goal late in the third period, the Capitals got a big boost from winger Tom Wilson, which they carried into overtime.\nWhen Avalanche defenseman Ian Cole\u2019s high hit away from the puck left Kuznetsov shaken up in the third period, Wilson immediately jumped in and challenged Cole. Wilson also fired up the crowd after landing some big punches when Cole obliged and dropped the gloves. Cole was assessed a game misconduct for the hit.\nKuznetsov got his own revenge on Cole and the Avalanche when winger Alexander Ovechkin sprung him on a breakaway and he slid the puck past former Capitals goalie Semyon Varlamov to win the game.\n\u201cWe all know Tom plays physical,\u201d said Kuznetsov. \u201cWhen (expletive) like that happened he stood up, and it\u2019s always nice to have a guy like that.\u201d\nThe Capitals got contributions from their stars in Ovechkin and Kuznetsov, but role players also stepped up in the Capitals victory.\n\u201cWe battled through some things that didn\u2019t go our way, and there was no quit, and we found a way to get two points,\u201d Reirden said.",

The game featured limited offensive output, with the Rams' offense particularly struggling due to injuries and strong defensive pressure.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks had barely noticed the ball was in the air by the time New England Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore jumped up and intercepted Rams quarterback Jared Goff at the 2-yard line late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIII on Sunday.\nThe Rams\u2019 offense had struggled all night, and Goff had rarely tried to throw downfield. But trailing by a touchdown and with an all-out blitz in his face, the third-year quarterback tried to force one.\nGilmore was more prepared for it than Cooks, and Gilmore\u2019s interception set up the Patriots\u2019 game-sealing drive during a 13-3 Super Bowl win that was dominated by defense.\n\u201cWhen they get towards the touchdown, they like to take shots. I knew he was going to chuck it up and I made a great play,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you dream about. It\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d\nThe Patriots\u2019 sixth Super Bowl win in the past 17 years featured their biggest margin of victory, but also perhaps the least excitement, with just one touchdown and two turnovers combined between the teams.\n\u201cThe Rams played so well. Their defense was great, they made it tough on every play,\u201d Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said. \u201cWe finally got a touchdown, and our defense had their best game of the year.\u201d\nNew England outgained the Rams, 407-206, but a few key plays early meant the Patriots could only muster a field goal before halftime, leading 3-0 at the break.\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, struggled on offense. Rams running back Todd Gurley had just three carries for 10 yards before halftime and didn\u2019t appear to be at full strength, battling a left knee injury that wasn\u2019t mentioned on Los Angeles\u2019 injury reports throughout practice but clearly seemed to be an issue, with backup CJ Anderson receiving more carries than Gurley.\nAfter the game, however, Gurley and head coach Sean McVay again insisted the star running back was healthy.\nThere were no injuries \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 to blame for the anemic passing attack, however. Goff finished 19-38 for 229 yards and an interception, never looking like the quarterback that led the NFL\u2019s best offense in 2018.\n\u201c[The loss] kills, and it hurts me so much just knowing how well our defense played,\u201d Goff said. \u201cTo play that well defensively and us not hold up our end of the bargain. It\u2019s our job to score points, and we didn\u2019t do that tonight.\u201d\nAfter driving to the 34-yard line on the opening drive, Brady\u2019s first pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Corey Littleton after being tipped by cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman.\nOn their next drive, the Patriots faced a fourth-and-5 from the 28-yard line and attempted a field goal, but kicker Stephen Gostkowski pushed the field goal wide left.\nLater in the half, New England was on the brink of field goal range before a sack from defensive end John Franklin-Myers pushed them back. The Rams\u2019 defensive line was winning enough battles to prevent Brady from getting too comfortable and stop the running game from chewing up time of possession.\n\u201cWe moved the ball decent, we just couldn\u2019t get the points on the board for one reason or another,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut in the end, it feels a lot better than last year, when we did get some points on the board [and lost].\u201d\nThe Rams finally got on the board with their third series of the second half, when a series of Goff passes led to a field goal. For a couple of seconds, however, the drive seemed destined to end with a touchdown.\nOn first down from the 29-yard line, Goff fired a pass to Cooks, who was standing all alone in the back of the end zone. But the pass took long enough to arrive that cornerback Jason McCourty had just enough time to recover and come all the way across the field to break up the pass as it arrived.\n\u201cJust running my tail off on the backside,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great play as a defense, but we were able to get the ball out.\u201d\nMcCourty\u2019s desperation play held the Rams to a 53-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein that locked the game at 3-3 entering the fourth quarter.\nThe Patriots\u2019 touchdown drive was a flash, needing just five plays and 2:49 to go 69 yards and score. Brady began the series with four consecutive passes, the final being a 29-yard touch pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski that put brought the Patriots down to the 2-yard line and setting up a score from running back Sony Michel.\nLos Angeles nearly had an answer, with Goff throwing for completions of 19 yards, 11 yards and 17 yards to put the Rams on the 27-yard line. There, he tried to find Cooks in the end zone twice. After the first was broken up, Gilmore was in perfect position to intercept the next.\n\u201cStephon got the pick and then we were able to run a bunch down and [Gostkowski] kicked a field goal,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThat was a great way to end it.\u201d\nThe Patriots then chewed up 3:05 of the final 4:17 with a 72-yard drive that ended with a field goal, putting the Rams down two scores with just more than a minute to play and no timeouts.\nZuerlein missed a 48-yard field goal with eight seconds left to seal it completely, and the Patriots left Mercedes Benz-Stadium with another ring.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d said wide receiver Julian Edelman, whose 141 receiving yards earned him MVP honors, \u201cbut I\u2019ll take that ugly win over a pretty loss any day.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Micah Kiser, a former Gilman School football player now with the Los Angeles Rams, reflects on the competitive high school football landscape in Baltimore that has changed significantly since his time, particularly with St. Frances Academy's rise to dominance and the subsequent changes in league dynamics.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 For the three years Micah Kiser played varsity football at Gilman School in Baltimore, the Greyhounds and Calvert Hall were two of the best teams in the state and played a series of instant-classics, most memorably a 2011 MIAA championship that went to double overtime.\nThe Cardinals got the best of Gilman in 2010 by completing a 19-point comeback with a scoop-and-score on a high snap on a punt to steal an upset win, and Gilman capped a two-game sweep the next year by batting down a Calvert Hall two-point conversion attempt to secure its second title of a three-championship, four-year run.\nAbout six years after he graduated, Kiser is preparing for Super Bowl LIII with the Los Angeles Rams, while the MIAA is fractured to the degree that it canceled the 2018 playoffs. St. Frances Academy\u2019s emergence as not only a local powerhouse, but one of the best teams in the nation, has caused the rest of the league to bow out of playing them.\nMost of the four Maryland high school products playing in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the Rams and New England Patriots were in school less than a decade ago, but were competing in a high school football landscape that looks much different than today\u2019s, most notably for Kiser and the Baltimore private schools.\n\u201cPlaying Baltimore sports when I was there, we had the best athletes in any sport,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cFor them to kind of shy away from competition the way they did was kind of disappointing to me. A lot of guys can play college ball at Mount Saint Joseph. At McDonough. And for them to kind of shy away from playing the team, I wouldn\u2019t have done that. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\nMany of those schools, however, would argue St. Frances is a different program than anything that came before it. The change began in 2016, when the Gilman coaching staff led by Biff Poggi had a falling out with school administration and elected to move en masse to the previously lowly St. Frances.\nKiser still harbors some resentment toward his alma mater for what he feels was an ousting of coaches he credits with helping turn him into an NFL-caliber player.\n\u201cI think Gilman kind of dropped the ball,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cThere was a misconception that there was a bunch of recruited players, when that wasn\u2019t the case. \u2026 Seeing what they did with the program was disappointing.\u201d\nEven after Kiser\u2019s former coaches moved to St. Frances, though, they weren\u2019t expecting the response that came from the rest of the league, nor the headlines that followed. After going undefeated in the MIAA in 2016, the Panthers kicked it up a notch in 2017, outscoring their league opponents by a combined score of 343-50 and finishing the season as a consensus top-five team in the nation.\nThen, beginning around Memorial Day last year, Baltimore teams began dropping off St. Frances\u2019 schedule, most citing safety concerns. With the notion of playing a regular schedule suddenly out the window, head coach Henry Russell and the rest of his staff scrambled to craft a schedule on par with their national standing, filled with the high school football elite.\n\u201cThe timing of it really caught us off guard,\u201d Russell said. \u201cFrom that point on, it was really just trying to get a schedule and give our kids an opportunity to have a football season.\u201d\nBefore the season, the MIAA announced St. Frances as champion and said there would be no playoffs in 2018. St. Frances went undefeated against a schedule that included no Baltimore teams and only one Maryland team but still wasn\u2019t up to its caliber. The Panthers\u2019 lowest margin of victory was 29 points.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some of the teams [like] Spaulding and St. Joe would\u2019ve liked an opportunity to play us,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\nControversy remains on both sides. St. Frances detractors say Poggi\u2019s staff has turned St. Frances into a football factory, not a school. Its supporters say some of the critiques are racially motivated, pointing out that nobody had complaints when Poggi was leading Gilman \u2014 a whiter, wealthier school located much further from inner-city Baltimore \u2014 to MIAA domination.\nBut whatever the reasons, the result is a league that is a shell of its former self. And to some third-parties like legendary Good Counsel head coach Bob Milloy, who retired in 2017, that is something to mourn.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the local league championship and rivalries, because nobody will play them,\u201d Milloy told Povich Center/Capital News Service. \u201cThat\u2019s a drawback, I think. That\u2019s a part of high school football. \u2026 But they have a goal, which is to be No. 1 in the country. And hey, that\u2019s what they want to do, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good for some kids, it\u2019s not good for all the kids.\u201d\nRussell tries not to dwell on what\u2019s missing from the St. Frances schedule, instead focusing on the impressive teams the Panthers will play, like the vaunted IMG Academy.\n\u201cOur kids have a unique opportunity to play some of the nation\u2019s best. We\u2019re playing IMG next year in the middle of October, which wouldn\u2019t have happened if we were still playing the Baltimore schools,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting stuff for our kids. They\u2019ve gotten a lot of support from all sorts of people in the community, and I think they like representing Baltimore and Maryland on a national scale.\u201d\nRams defensive back Blake Countess, who transferred from Gilman to Good Counsel for his final two years of high school, agreed with many of Milloy\u2019s thoughts about the loss of the local schedule.\nBut he also accurately points out that St. Frances is merely following a blueprint crafted by other schools like IMG Academy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the culture of high school football now. These coaches, they get together and they\u2019re running it kind of like a prep school [or] college,\u201d said Countess, who graduated in 2011. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s for the better of the player, but I think it takes away a little bit from the competition. \u2026 But definitely, in my opinion, if you can go to private school, you go.\u201d\nAccording to most, the gap between private schools \u2014 especially those in the powerful WCAC in the Washington D.C. area \u2014 and public schools has only widened in recent years.\nAs recently as 2015, the final Washington Post football rankings of the year had eight public schools in the top 10. Last year, private schools had four of the top-five and six of the top 10.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare [public and private],\u201d said Bryan Pierre, longtime coach of Northwestern High School, a public school in Hyattsville, Maryland, where Rams safety John Johnson graduated from in 2013. \u201cWe don\u2019t try to compare nor try to compete. At a public school, you just have the kids that are in your neighborhood.\u201d\nThere are still some public school powerhouses in the area, notably Wise (Upper Marlboro) and Quince Orchard (Gaithersburg), but the general consensus is that the difference between the haves and have nots has never been greater.\nThat\u2019s true for the gulf between public and private schools, and also between most private schools and the truly elite, like St. Frances. And while that growing disparity leads to its fair share of skepticism and bitterness, with four Maryland high school products in the Super Bowl coming from a variety of backgrounds and places, the players and coaches involved view this moment as a time to celebrate the football talent in the area rather than begrudge anybody else their success.\n\u201cThe high school football game is on a national stage. ESPN has taken us to new realms,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cGonzaga and St. John\u2019s and DeMatha during this year were in the top 25 in the national rankings. That\u2019s huge for our area. \u2026 I\u2019m not upset because it\u2019s another Maryland football team on a national stage. I\u2019m rooting for that.

    "summary": "John Johnson abandoned his basketball career at Northwestern High School to focus on football, a decision that led to significant physical improvements and college scholarships. Now a standout safety for the Los Angeles Rams, Johnson's competitive drive and dramatic flair have propelled him to the Super Bowl.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 One day in the winter of 2011, John Johnson\u2019s father stopped by a Northwestern High School basketball practice to check up on his son, who was the team\u2019s starting point guard as a sophomore the year prior.\nWhen he got there, Johnson was nowhere to be found. In fact, he hadn\u2019t picked up a basketball since the end of the football season. Without telling anybody, Johnson had quit the Wildcats basketball team in order to chase the football scholarships offers he felt he could garner if he devoted himself fully to the gridiron.\nJohnson\u2019s dad was so incensed that he didn\u2019t talk to his son for days, and the school\u2019s football coaches were suddenly in the line of fire from him as well as the basketball staff, Johnson remembers. But just about every day for the next three months, Johnson worked out in the weight room \u2014 and in the hallway outside of it \u2014 and added about 15 pounds on his previously lean frame, coinciding with a growth spurt that pushed him to about 6-feet and put him on the radar of colleges.\nThat unyielding determination and competitiveness, combined with an adept football mind, have turned Johnson into a rising star at safety for the Los Angeles Rams, maintaining the upward trajectory he began by bursting onto the scene late in his career at his Prince George\u2019s County public high school.\n\u201cJohn is the most fiery, competitive, driven young man that I have coached,\u201d said Steve Rapp, who coached Johnson at Northwestern. \u201cHe just \u2014 he\u2019s got the dog in him. He\u2019s got the dog.\u201d\nJohnson has always been headstrong and possessed a flair for the dramatic. From telling Rapp he was going to \u201cmake a power move\u201d but not specifying that meant his basketball days were over, to his use of the New Orleans-originated Choppa Style celebration after intercepting Saints quarterback Drew Brees in overtime of the NFC championship game, Johnson doesn\u2019t shy from the spotlight, seemingly made for the type of stage Super Bowl LIII will provide him Sunday.\nNorthwestern head coach Bryan Pierre remembers Johnson stepping up in big games, like his senior year performance against local powerhouse Wise High School in 2012, when the Wildcats revamped the offense in order to get the ball in Johnson\u2019s hands as much as possible as a wildcat quarterback. Wise cruised to a 47-8 victory, but Johnson filled up the stat sheet with passes, receptions and rushes, scored all of his team\u2019s points by rushing in a 40-yard touchdown and then converting the two-point conversion on a fake field goal.\nAccording to Rapp, who is now offensive coordinator at Wise, it\u2019s not enough to merely say Johnson played both ways for the Wildcats, pointing out that he did everything from quarterback to long snap.\n\u201cHe played everything except the D-Line and the O-Line,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cHe would go, \u2018Alright, well I could throw the ball farther than you. Well, I\u2019m faster than you. I can hit harder. I can cover better. You need me to do that, coach? No problem. I got it.\u2019\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just Johnson\u2019s competitiveness that turned him into such a versatile weapon for the Wildcats, and later Boston College and the Rams.\nHis mental aptitude allowed him to absorb game plans from a number of different positions, and it allowed Pierre plenty of peace of mind. When Pierre couldn\u2019t make a 7-on-7 tournament, Rapp was concerned, but Pierre assured him Johnson could handle the defensive play-calling duties. Sure enough, they went on to win the tournament, Rapp said.\n\u201cI always tried to be a leader. Everybody knew I was a leader, me and [running back Darius Victor], we were the leaders,\u201d Johnson said at Super Bowl media night Monday. \u201cWe could\u2019ve done it without any coaches.\u201d\nJohnson eventually caught the attention of various colleges and settled on Boston College, where he got playing time as a true freshman and added 22 pounds over his four years while bouncing between safety and cornerback.\nThe Rams liked what they saw on tape and what they heard from his college coaches, Los Angeles safeties coach Ejiro Evero said Monday, so they selected Johnson in the third round of the 2017 draft. He started 11 games as a freshman and all 18 en route to the Super Bowl this year, helping clinch the Rams\u2019 trip to Atlanta by intercepting Brees.\n\u201cSince we drafted him, it\u2019s been everything we thought we were getting,\u201d Evero said. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically give a player with that little experience as much to handle as we do, but he never flinches. Never blinks.\u201d\nBecause Pierre stayed at his public high school rather than one of the area\u2019s vaunted private options, the Wildcats coaching staff had to put in extra hours in order to get Johnson the exposure he needed. It\u2019s a process Rapp is plenty familiar with \u2014 driving around the country for showcases and campus visits, the dozens of emails to college coaches \u2014 and Johnson never considered transferring once he got to Northwestern.\n\u201cI just like the chip on your shoulder, the edge that public schools have,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey can recruit. We can\u2019t. We just got a bunch of guys from the neighborhood. I just like the family aspect.\u201d\nThat close-knit nature explains why Rapp texts Johnson compliments or critiques of his play as he watches him on Sundays.\nIt explains why Northwestern put a photo of Johnson\u2019s Choppa Style celebration on their morning announcements last week.\nAnd it explains why Johnson took a risk after his junior season of football, putting his future in Rapp\u2019s hands following a brief conversation that Rapp didn\u2019t immediately realize the importance of. But when the offensive coordinator saw Johnson in the weight room day after day rather than on the hardwood, it became clear the switch had flipped, and Johnson had found a new gear that would propel him from being an undersized safety lacking the Division I offers he needed to being a highlight machine on the biggest stage in American sports eight years later.\n\u201cI just had to make a sacrifice. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It ended up paying off, as you can see, because I got to this point,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I want to be great and I know what it takes in order to be great.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Micah Kiser, a Los Angeles Rams linebacker, demonstrated his high football IQ early in his career at Gilman School in Baltimore, where he made a critical play against Don Bosco Prep's undefeated team. Despite a challenging preseason moment in 2018, Kiser's coaches believe his instinctual and aware playing style could lead to success in the NFL.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 As Los Angeles Rams linebacker Micah Kiser came downfield toward the Houston Texans backfield during the third week of the 2018 NFL preseason, he was met by Texans offensive lineman Roderick Johnson. \nJohnson pushed Kiser back about 10 yards, thwarted the rookie\u2019s grasping attempts to bring down running back Lavon Coleman and eventually sent Kiser to the ground as the play ended. \nA few minutes later, Kiser again charged toward the line of scrimmage as Coleman took a handoff. This time, Kiser deftly sidestepped a pulling lineman and immediately engulfed Coleman with a textbook tackle, dropping him for a 2-yard loss. \nOnce the regular season began, Kiser hardly played defensive snaps, but the Woodlawn, Maryland, native\u2019s coaches say his strong football IQ gives him the potential to shine as an NFL linebacker down the road. To capitalize on that promise, he must minimize plays like the unfortunate encounter with Johnson and turn in more like the eye-catching tackle for loss. \n\u201cHe has that God-given trait,\u201d Rams linebackers coach Joe Barry said Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy that\u2019s highly instinctual and highly aware. \u2026 Those are traits that guys just have.\u201d\nLong before Kiser and the Rams earned a trip to Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots in Atlanta Feb. 3, his advanced grasp of the mental side of the game was on display at Gilman School in Baltimore, where he started for three years at middle linebacker. \nDuring Kiser\u2019s senior season in 2012, Gilman played Don Bosco Prep (New Jersey), which had a nation-leading 46-game win streak. With Don Bosco leading 6-0 in the first quarter and threatening to score again, Kiser dropped back into coverage and spotted an Ironman receiver running an out route.  \nIt was a play Gilman had practiced during the week leading up to the highly anticipated game, and Kiser executed perfectly. Both Kiser and Henry Russell, Gilman\u2019s linebackers coach at the time, vividly remember what happened next. \nKiser closed on the receiver and got there in plenty of time to pick off the pass. Seventy-one yards and a broken tackle later, Kiser returned it for a touchdown that sparked Gilman\u2019s 13-6 win. \n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely smart. He understood what offenses were trying to do and what we would do as a defense to take that away,\u201d Russell said. \u201cMentally, he\u2019s probably the strongest kid I\u2019ve coached at the linebacker position. \u2026 That\u2019s a big reason of why he\u2019s in the NFL.\u201d\nKiser attributes some of his football savvy to his time at Gilman, where coaches had him learn the entire defense so he could help better prepare his teammates on the field. That gave him a broader understanding of the importance and usefulness of game film, and the pick-six against Don Bosco and tackle for loss against the Texans are examples of something he learned from his high school defensive coordinator, Stan White.\n\u201cDefense is reactionary. You\u2019re always reacting to what the offense does. Coach White always said if you can get a couple of extra steps, that will help you,\u201d Kiser said at media night Monday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all about studying the game and knowing what they\u2019re going to do to you before it happens.\u201d\nKiser\u2019s intelligence extended to the classroom. While playing at Virginia, he made multiple Academic All-America teams and won the Campbell Trophy \u2014 often referred to as the \u201cAcademic Heisman\u201d \u2014 his senior year. \nStill, during the draft process last spring, Barry had to do his due diligence. And when he called Cavaliers head coach Bronco Mendenhall, he was blown away by the endorsement. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a head coach talk about a player the way [Mendenhall] talked about Micah,\u201d Barry said. \u201cAnd being around the kid for seven months, all those things that were said about him were absolutely true.\u201d\nLos Angeles took Kiser in the fifth round, and the 6-foot, 244-pound linebacker has been doing all he can to impress them since. He led the team with 26 total tackles during the preseason, while no other Ram had more than 13. \n\u201cThe best way to describe him is just a productive football player,\u201d head coach Sean McVay told reporters after the preseason. \u201cJoe Barry and [assistant linebackers coach] Chris Shula have done an excellent job with him. He is just getting better and better.\u201d\nHowever, there are still strides Kiser needs to take, Barry said. \n\u201cThe NFL game compared to the college game is night-and-day different, just from a speed perspective,\u201d Barry said. \u201cHe\u2019s smart. He knows everything. But to be able to match [running] backs and cover backs, and match tight ends and cover tight ends. For him to go to the next level, he has to be able to do that.\u201d\nFortunately, Barry considers those goals reachable \u2014 and teachable. Russell called Kiser \u201ca coach\u2019s dream\u201d due to his approach to the game, and Barry gushes about the rookie for the same reason. His cerebral approach raises his ceiling as an NFL prospect and gives the Rams plenty of reason to work on raising the other areas of his game to match the level of his intelligence. \n\u201cI can teach a linebacker how to use his hands better. Teach him how to use his feet better. You can go in the weight room and get stronger,\u201d Barry said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t teach instincts. You can\u2019t teach awareness. \u2026 He just has God-given natural instincts and awareness when it comes to playing the game of football.\n\u201cIf he can do all those things as far as adapting to the speed of the game, then you\u2019ve got a damn good NFL linebacker. And he\u2019s right there.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

His journey from being cut from Florida's program to a key player on a championship team highlights his resilience and rapid development.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 About a week into New England Patriots training camp last summer, 10th-year pro Jason McCourty had a question for rookie cornerback JC Jackson.\n\u201cHow did you not get drafted?\u201d\nIt was a mystery Jackson had likely given plenty of thought to during the months since the NFL Draft, when all 256 picks went by without any team calling his name.\nBut shortly after the University of Maryland product signed with New England as an undrafted free agent, McCourty and the Patriots realized he could make an impact on defense. Not even Jackson anticipated having the role he\u2019s taken on late in the season, however, as he enters Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams with six starts in New England\u2019s past seven games.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s kind of eye-opening for him,\u201d McCourty said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cEverything\u2019s a new learning experience.\u201d\nWith Jackson and McCourty watching from the bench while the Patriots\u2019 offense marched down the field in overtime of the AFC championship, it was Jackson\u2019s turn to ask the veteran a question.\n\u201cHe\u2019s asking me, \u2018If we go down and score right now, what does that mean?\u2019 McCourty recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018If we go down and score, just come with me. We\u2019re going to sprint on the field because the game\u2019s going to be over.\u2019\u201d\nSure enough, quarterback Tom Brady and the Patriots finished off the Kansas City Chiefs with a touchdown and set off the celebration for Jackson and the rest of the team.\nIt\u2019s a height that Jackson seemed unlikely to reach at many points during his career. A four-star recruit from Immokalee, Florida, Jackson played the first game of his true freshman season at Florida but suffered a season-ending injury. He would never take the field again for the Gators, being cut from the program following an arrest on charges he was later fully acquitted of.\nThe 6-foot-1, 198-pound defensive back went across the country to Riverside City College in California for a season that tested his resolve and desire to play football before returning to Division I at Maryland.\n\u201cTry to get to the NFL, that was my main goal [at Maryland]. Get my degree and try to make football a living,\u201d Jackson said at media day Monday. \u201cI was more honed and more focused. Going to Maryland, it was just different. That was the most focused I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\nIn his two years as a Terp, Jackson started 23 of 24 games, tallying four interceptions, 13 pass breakups and 80 tackles. He declared for the draft after the 2017 season and received an invite to the NFL combine, where he had respectable results across the board and maintained his late-round draft stock.\nInstead, he went undrafted, which Jackson still struggles to find the words to describe.\n\u201cIt was just \u2014 I had to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was out of my control. I just dealt with going undrafted, and I took advantage of my opportunity. All I really needed was an opportunity.\u201d\nReviewing his options as a free agent after the draft, Jackson chose to sign with the Patriots due to the quality of their organization, he said.\nNew England cornerbacks coach Josh Boyer was impressed by Jackson\u2019s skillset but also saw a need for further development.\n\u201cHe was a physical player, he had good movement skills, he was strong at the top of the route. And there was some things that you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, we need to work on this, but we can work with this,\u2019\u201d Boyer said. \u201cThe college game and the pro game is different. \u2026 There\u2019s an adjustment period there.\u201d\nSo, despite Boyer describing Jackson as \u201cvery competitive\u201d during offseason OTAs and training camp, the rookie was inactive for the first two weeks and was a healthy scratch again in Week 6. He\u2019s played every game since, however, earning his first start in Week 13 and starting every game except the divisional round since.\n\u201cThe kid can play, and he can cover his butt off,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see him just work and work.\u201d\nOne of the keys to Jackson\u2019s emergence, Boyer said, was coachability. Cornerback Duron Harmon, who\u2019s been with the Patriots since 2013, said Jackson frequently asks him questions during meetings and film sessions.\n\u201cI saw a hungry young player who had phenomenal man-to-man skills who was eager to learn,\u201d Harmon said Monday. \u201cAlways wanting to talk football. It\u2019s the reason we have asked him to go out there and play the significant plays that he\u2019s played, and he\u2019s played them at a high level.\u201d\nJackson has three interceptions and eight pass deflections this season, featuring in both the Patriots\u2019 nickel and base packages at various times late in the year. Despite being undrafted and not becoming a key part of the defense until the end of the season, however, Jackson and his teammates feel he\u2019s still a similar player to the one that came into training camp and quickly caught McCourty\u2019s attention.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize Jackson belonged on the field, and since he first made it there, it\u2019s been hard to take him off.\n\u201cOnce he got his opportunity to play and go out there, he showed he can play at a high level,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cEver since then, he hasn\u2019t looked back.\u201d\nIndeed, as Jackson milled around the Super Bowl media night festivities, he wasn\u2019t overly eager to reflect on the moments of his life when it seemed he wouldn\u2019t be here. But he knows what reaching the Super Bowl represents, no matter the path he took to it.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I\u2019m here now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let this speak for itself. Being here is going to speak for itself. You\u2019re at the Super Bowl, that means you\u2019re doing something.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

Despite facing setbacks, including a torn ACL in college, Countess has emerged as an unsung hero on the Rams\u2019 journey to Super Bowl LIII.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 As Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff peeled off his helmet and headed toward the sidelines in the second quarter of the NFC championship, Blake Countess settled into his upback position and scanned the New Orleans Saints\u2019 formation, checking whether their coverage was susceptible to the fake punt called by Rams special teams coach John Fassel.\nPunter Johnny Hekker may have been the one who threw the first-down pass and extended a drive that eventually turned into the Rams\u2019 first points of their comeback victory, but it\u2019s Countess who really took on the role of quarterback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s our Swiss Army knife,\u201d Fassel said at Super Bowl media day on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s on every phase of every [special teams] play. He\u2019s taking over 30 snaps a game just on special teams.\u201d\nCountess hit some bumps in the road after shining for legendary coach Bob Milloy at Good Counsel High School in Olney, Maryland, from 2007-2011, but he\u2019s found a home on Fassel\u2019s vaunted special teams units and is an unsung hero of the Rams\u2019 run to Super Bowl LIII, where they will face the New England Patriots on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just one of those guys that is just steady,\u201d Milloy told Capital News Service. \u201cHe\u2019s not spectacular, but he is, in his own way. You have to be spectacular to be in that league four years.\u201d\nCountess\u2019 natural athleticism as a cornerback at Good Counsel helped earn him a scholarship to Michigan, where he made starts as a true freshman in 2011 and was slated to take a step forward during his sophomore campaign. Just two drives into the 2012 season-opener, however, he tore his ACL.\n\u201cI had a great camp and I was feeling good about myself,\u201d Countess said at media day. \u201c[After the injury], I had to look at myself in the mirror and really bounce back.\u201d\nFollowing surgery to repair his knee, Countess returned to the field in 2013 and garnered All-Big Ten honors. But his college career had another twist when Jim Harbaugh took over before the 2015 season. Cornerbacks in Harbaugh\u2019s defenses are typically expected to press receivers at the line of scrimmage, and standing at 5-foot-10, 191 pounds, Countess relies more on his speed than strength.\nThe Owings Mills, Maryland, native transferred to Auburn for his final year of eligibility, which provided him the opportunity to show his versatility. In addition to playing cornerback for the Tigers, Countess made starts at nickelback and safety.\n\u201cBeing able to add that to my resume at the level of the SEC was exactly what I needed at the time,\u201d Countess said.\nMoving around the field wasn\u2019t entirely new for Countess. He\u2019s always been defensive-minded, but Milloy and his then-offensive coordinator, Andy Stefanelli, also used Countess on offense.\n\u201cThat ability to adapt and go where you\u2019re needed has served him well throughout his career,\u201d Stefanelli told Capital News Service.\nAfter Countess showed some of that adaptability at Auburn, the Philadelphia Eagles selected him in the sixth round of the 2016 draft. Philadelphia cut Countess after the preseason, though, and despite having battled adversity during college, Countess said the experience of being cut was uniquely challenging.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything can prepare you for that moment,\u201d Countess said. \u201c[But] this league is a business. If you play long enough, you more than likely will get cut at some point.\u201d\nStefanelli, meanwhile, hoped Countess\u2019 over-before-it-started stint with the Eagles wasn\u2019t the end of the road in the NFL.\n\u201cIf you give him a chance, he\u2019s going to show you what he can do,\u201d said Stefanelli, who took over as Good Counsel head coach following Milloy\u2019s retirement in 2017. \u201cBut being a little bit of an undersized guy, you wonder, \u2018Is he going to get the opportunity?\u2019\u201d\nThe Rams picked up Countess early in the 2016 season, but he didn\u2019t make his NFL debut until Week 12 of Los Angeles\u2019 4-12 campaign. Sean McVay took over the Rams\u2019 head coaching job the next year and overhauled most of the coaching staff, leaving Fassel as one of the only holdovers from the Jeff Fisher regime. That allowed Fassel and Countess to continue to build their budding partnership.\nCountess has always shown an affinity for special teams, Milloy said, as evidenced by his numerous returning touchdowns at Good Counsel. He\u2019s filled in as a returner at times with the Rams, but most of his impact comes from the other areas of special teams.\n\u201cBlake is a tireless worker,\u201d Hekker said. \u201c[He\u2019s] a core contributor on every phase of special teams. He\u2019s a guy that has earned a lot of respect in our locker room.\u201d\nFassel said plays like the fake punt against the Saints are only possible because of Countess\u2019 work ethic.\n\u201cWhat Jared Goff does every down is basically what [Countess] does on punts. \u2026 There\u2019s a trust level where you can\u2019t just throw anybody in there to do it,\u201d Fassel said. \u201cIf you\u2019re nodding off in a meeting or you\u2019re jacking around in practice, we\u2019re probably not calling it, or we\u2019re messing it up.\u201d\nCountess\u2019 drive and tenacity allowed him to overcome the knee injury and coaching change at Michigan, the disappointment of being cut by Philadelphia and being undersized at a position that continues to demand more height and strength.\nAnd now, his dedication and attention to detail helped the Rams to their first Super Bowl appearance since 2001.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not one of those 22 starters, you have to have some special teams value or you will not be on the roster for very long,\u201d Countess said. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to take a rep off or slack in one area, ultimately that\u2019s going to come back and bite you. That\u2019s kind of the approach I\u2019ve had since I was little.\n\u201cI\u2019m a [special-teamer] right now. That\u2019s my role this year. \u2026 And on special teams, we\u2019ve made plays that dictate the outcome of games.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Carie Dever-Boaz, despite initial reluctance, became the head coach of the Washington Glory, a professional women\u2019s softball team that won the NPF Championship in its first year but faced financial difficulties leading to its dissolution before the 2009 season. Despite early success, the team's struggles included late paychecks and a shrinking fan base, ultimately resulting in the players' contracts being sold to the USSSA Pride.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Carie Dever-Boaz was ready to step away from coaching college softball when the phone rang.\nAfter spending two years at the University of Virginia as the Cavaliers\u2019 head softball coach, Dever-Boaz was expecting to make the trip back to her home area of Memphis, Tennessee, to spend time with family and put college softball in the background of her 12-year coaching career.\nShe was not expecting a man named Paul Wilson to give her a call that changed her plans. He was starting a professional women\u2019s softball team called the Washington Glory, and he wanted her to be the head coach.\n\u201cI said \u2018I am not interested and you can\u2019t afford me,\u2019 jokingly,\u201d Dever-Boaz recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018throw out a price,\u2019 so I threw out something I thought was absurd\u2026and he said, \u2018OK, it\u2019s a done deal.\u2019\u201d\nAfter talking it over with her family, Dever-Boaz agreed, and in 2007 she and Wilson created one of the hottest teams in the National Pro Fastpitch league.\nFormer Washington Glory player Stephanie Best takes a swing at a pitch. (Photo courtesy of Paul Wilson)\nThe Glory won the NPF Championship in its first year, finishing 34-10. The roster was riddled with high-profile talent like former University of Tennessee pitcher Monica Abbott and longtime veterans.\nOn the surface, it appeared as if the team was trending up with no signs of peaking any time soon. \nBut the success was actually a facade for a cold reality: the team was broke.\n\u201cWhat happened\u2026really was a sad state of affairs,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \nThe team was moved from its original home at George Mason University to Westfield Softball Complex in Fairfax County before the 2008 season. Paychecks started to come later and later. And the fan base that regularly filled 500 seats for home games had decreased.\nThe team made it back to the championship but lost to the Chicago Bandits. Eventually, the team acquired too much debt and folded before the 2009 season.\nThe players\u2019 contracts were sold to the USSSA Pride and shipped to Florida. Some players, like Abbott, continued to play softball long after their days with the Glory. Others didn\u2019t make it that long and pursued other careers.\nBut the feeling wasn\u2019t the same. The culture was different, and there are many who were associated with the organization who wish it had ended differently. \u00a0\n\u201cThe first season couldn\u2019t be any more than a dream season,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cBut in the last half of the second season, there was so much stress on everyone.\u201d\nStrong chemistry and a unique environment \nWilson\u2019s plan for bringing professional softball to the Washington region actually started a year earlier than he anticipated. National Pro Fastpitch wanted to quickly replace a team that had left the league, the Connecticut Braketts, so Wilson was asked to create the Glory by the start of the next season.\nThe next 45 days were filled with the process of forming the team. Finding a place to play was easy; Wilson struck a deal with GMU, which immediately got to work installing lights and stadium seating at one of its softball fields. \nWilson said he was running at \u201cMach Three\u201d to get the team going, but he took his time to find the right players.\n\u201cI wanted us to be real particular about the types of people the players would be,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just their physical capability in softball. It was also about who they were and if they were willing to give back to the community.\u201d\nEstablishing a presence in the community was a common goal for many fastpitch teams, according to former catcher Germaine Fairchild, who had been in the league since 1998 before joining the Glory through a supplemental draft. \nAt its best, the effort felt a little forced with other teams. But it was different with the Glory, Fairchild said. It actually felt real.\n\u201cWith other teams, it was just sitting at some tables in a shopping mall,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really engaging. The spirit was a little more genuine with the Glory.\u201d\nThe team hosted regular clinics that offered the chance for younger players to learn from professional players. But the clinics also gave them a chance to build a rapport with the Glory\u2019s players and provided role models in the sport.\nFAIRFAX, Virginia \u2013 Fans crowd the stands at one of the Washington Glory home games at George Mason University. (Photo courtesy of Paul Wilson)\n\u201cThere was no better feeling,\u201d former shortstop Amber Jackson said of working with younger players. \u201cIt was so special. You\u2019re now a role model for these kids. It was a great thing for some of them who thought they couldn\u2019t play after college.\u201d\nPlayers were encouraged to interact with the fans, who were highly engaged and interested in the game. Players sat in the stands, rather than the dugout, between innings to create a more personal relationship between athletes and the fan base. \nThat was exactly what Wilson wanted to do.\n\u201cWe told the ladies before they even signed a contract that it was important for us to have a fun, family-oriented atmosphere,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd there were a lot of dedicated fans who were invested in what was happening on the field as well as the ladies\u2019 lives.\u201d\nFrom a talent perspective, Dever-Boaz wanted a team that had speed and power. The team played in multiple, five-game series throughout the season, so pitching was also a top priority. \n\u201cThe team we created was so well-balanced,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cWe were looking for that speed and power, and we had that. We had a lot of home-run hitters. We were just a well-balanced team.\u201d\nPlayers from as far as California made the trip to Northern Virginia two weeks before the season began. But in a short amount of time, the team clicked and built a strong chemistry.\nThat was helped by the fact that the players did almost everything together. They visited local restaurants after every home game. Most of the players couldn\u2019t permanently move to the area because of full-time jobs in other areas, so during the season they lived in dorms at GMU, paid for by the team.\n\u201cIt was just like college,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe created an environment where we could have fun off the field. It felt like we were invited into the family.\u201d\nSo when the team started winning, it just made sense to the players.\n\u201cThere was definitely a kind spiritual element, if you will, to the fan base and the team,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cIt was as much a close-knit family atmosphere as you were going to get.\u201d\nNo stands, no money\nBut as the 2008 season began, the players had a problem: they weren\u2019t getting paid.\nProfessional softball players generally do not receive much compensation. At the time, each team had a $100,000 salary cap. The Glory\u2019s pitching staff made the most money, but the majority of players earned between $2,500 and $5,000 for a three-month season. \nNow, that small but important amount of money was not coming in anymore.\nPlayers from the Washington Glory celebrate their National Pro Fastpitch Championship in 2007. (Photo courtesy of Sol Tucker)\n\u201cSome of those girls were playing six weeks without being paid,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \nWhile Wilson did not recall checks getting paid that late, he admitted that checks came late on two occasions. Plans for a bridge loan did not go as planned, and the team was \u201ctapped out at that point,\u201d Wilson said.\nIn one instance that Wilson vividly remembers, the former owner drove to Philadelphia where the team was playing and told them personally that their checks would be late. \nHe offered any player who wanted to quit the team the permission to do so. But the players decided to stay.\nTo make matters worse, the team could no longer play at George Mason. The public university school system had to help pay for the $48.2 million in bills that had accumulated because of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, meaning budgets at all state universities, including GMU, were affected.\nSo, the team had to play at Westfield Softball Complex, located at Westfield High School in Fairfax, Virginia, meaning the team could not stay in the dorms at GMU.\n\u201cWe really became a close unit then,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cWe had nothing else but each other to really rely on.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s living arrangements had to be moved to hotel suites where they had access to kitchens in their rooms. But finding money for basic needs was still an issue, according to team photographer Sol Tucker, because he often helped players pay for food.\n\u201cThey could no longer afford to even live,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cAnd these are our personal friends, so we fed them and hooked them up. But I couldn\u2019t believe that he (Wilson) would do that to them.\u201d\nBut Wilson was also having his own personal issue to deal with as well. Wilson didn\u2019t have a business partner, so he was paying for most of the expenses out of pocket. That money began to run low, too, meaning one of the last proverbial pillars that was stabilizing the franchise was gone.\nUltimately, Wilson said, he underestimated the costs of owning a professional team. He didn\u2019t foresee the challenges that came with getting sponsorship revenue for advertising and television revenue. And there were other costs like putting up lights at GMU\u2019s field that ended up being too expensive for the team to afford.\n\u201cThe operating costs were about what expected,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was more about the ability to create the revenue around some of the sponsorship and advertising and trying to fill the stadium so quickly.\u201d\nEventually, the team could not afford to pay its debts and Wilson said he filed for bankruptcy. \u00a0\u00a0But he lost more than just a franchise.\n\u201cWe lost our house and cars after all that happened,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was a good learning experience. I wouldn\u2019t say that I wish I hadn\u2019t done it. It was a phenomenal experience. But it was tough for a couple of years after that.\u201d\nThe team lost the stands shortly after the move from GMU because it couldn\u2019t afford them, which was a blow to the fan base. The team\u2019s following was not as strong as it was at GMU, and the loss of the stands affected it even more.\n\u201cIt was a heartache at that point because we knew it was the end of the franchise,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cAnd it was really sad for us at that point because there was a core of us that had become exceedingly close.\u201d\nAfter it became clear the Glory could not be financed, the National Pro Fastpitch league took control of the team. Although there were some talks with a potential buyer to keep the team in the area, that effort was unsuccessful and the team collapsed.\nNational Pro Fastpitch Commissioner Cheri Kempf refused to comment on the team, other than to say the Glory became insolvent and became unable from a financial standpoint to continue operations. \nAlthough the team was defunct, the players\u2019 contracts were sold to the newly-organized USSSA Pride for the following season. Most didn\u2019t stay with the team, though. Dever-Boaz had recently stepped down from her position to spend more time with her family, as she originally planned two years earlier.\nJackson left shortly after moving to the Pride to pursue a career in coaching. Fairchild had left the previous year and is now coaching Division I softball herself.\nBut the players and coach still remember the team fondly. They still have good memories of those two years, even after the team went from being an integral part of their lives to a small piece of their careers in a span of months.\n\u201cIt was a wonderful dream to bring a team into the community like that,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right timing. And looking back\u2026if some things had happened differently, we probably could have been able to stick around.\u201d",

The team's establishment coincides with growing youth hockey participation in Maryland and the Washington Capitals' Stanley Cup victory, creating new opportunities for young players to compete locally.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Quinn Warmuth knew he wanted to play college hockey since eighth grade.\nNow, the 19-year-old defenseman is making that dream a reality with the Maryland Black Bears junior hockey team \u2014 the first North American Hockey League team in the state.\nBut first, Warmuth, an Olmstead, Ohio, native and the Black Bears\u2019 captain, hopes to establish a winning culture at the Odenton-based team, helping plot a roadmap for future Maryland players to eventually play college hockey.\nIn April, the Black Bears became the 24th member of the Tier II junior hockey league, which features a highly competitive brand of hockey for 16- to 21-year-olds who aspire to play collegiately. The league has produced several National Hockey League All-Stars in its 42-year history, including Phil Kessel of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 Patrick Kane.\nThe Black Bears arrived at a critical time for local hockey. Youth hockey participation in Maryland has trended upward in the last three seasons, topping 10,000 players for the second consecutive year, according to USA Hockey. The team will fill the gap between youth hockey and the college ranks, providing local talent with the opportunity to play competitively close to home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re put in a unique (position) where we can dictate what the future holds for this place,\u201d said Warmuth, the Black Bears\u2019 team captain. \u201cKids now from Maryland can play hockey here. They\u2019re never really going to have to leave home for the first time, which is really nice and a unique opportunity that they didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\nIn June, the Washington Capitals won the franchise\u2019s first Stanley Cup, which could further bolster participation, said Black Bears Head Coach and General Manager Clinton Mylymok. Mylymok called the timing of starting a junior hockey team the same year as the Capitals winning the Cup \u201cthe perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you win like that to create the buzz, it\u2019s not just for us it\u2019s for the sport in general,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cYou tend to see more people coming out to watch a game or also maybe learn to play the game.\u201d\nMaryland Black Bears winger and associate captain Connor Pooley takes a faceoff against Wilkes-Barre/Scranton during their North American Hockey League game at Piney Orchard Ice Arena in Odenton, Maryland, on Friday Nov. 30, 2018. (Photo by Brooks DuBose/Capital News Service)\nKevin Erlenbach, the assistant executive director of membership at USA Hockey, said the growth in player registration \u2014 mainly among players ages 8 and younger \u2014 will continue in the DC metro area for several years.\n\u201cEspecially the year after (a Cup win) you will see a surge in new players,\u201d Erlenbach said. \u201cThat wave rides for a while because there\u2019s a jump in retention because it\u2019s a bigger pool.\u201d\nMylymok and the players said the stands at home games \u2014 the team plays at Piney Orchard Arena, the Capital\u2019s former practice center in Odenton \u2014 are filled with fans decked out in red, white and blue Caps gear.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopefully filling the void for some people \u2026 it\u2019s not the NHL but it\u2019s really good hockey,\u201d Mylymok said.\nFriday night was no different, as about 300 fans crowded into the arena on Ugly Sweater Night to cheer on the Black Bears against Wilkes Barre/Scranton Knights. Though the team looked sharp in their Maryland flag-bedazzled alternate uniforms, they fell 6-3, dropping to 7-13-3-2 and fourth place in the East Division.\n\u201cThe fans have been great. We\u2019re getting great turnouts,\u201d Warmuth said. \u201cI think if we start winning even more I think more people are gonna come. This being our first year we\u2019re all pretty happy with the type of environment that we\u2019re playing in.\u201d\nAbout halfway through their inaugural season, the Black Bears have hit a rough patch, losing four straight and eight of their last 10, but Mylymok\u2019s mantra remains the same: play with desperation and intensity night-to-night.\n\u201cWin at all costs is great, but I like to win with the right people,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cI like to develop kids and move them on. I like to develop them as people. I don\u2019t want to sell my soul to win a championship.\u201d\nSince junior hockey is a preparatory league, rosters can see significant turnover year-to-year, which requires Mylymok to coach like it\u2019s a Division I program, he said, holding workouts and film sessions to simulate what players will experience in college, and even throwing pop quizzes to test players\u2019 knowledge.\n\u201cIt forces you every day to make sure that you\u2019re doing everything to make yourself (better),\u201d Warmuth said. \u201cJunior hockey is all about development so that when you get to the next level there are no surprises.\u201d\nEach Black Bears player is hosted by a local family \u2014 known as billets \u2014 which provide living accommodations, transportation and anything else players may need. In exchange, the families, who live in towns like Severn, Crownsville and Davidsonville, receive financial compensation from the team.\nMylymok called billets \u201cthe most important thing\u201d outside of a strong ownership group to running a successful junior hockey team.\n\u201cThese are young teenagers that need a comfortable place to be,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cWhen you have a poor billet and you have distractions, it affects their play directly. Honestly, you can tell if the kid\u2019s having a tough time at home or there\u2019s an issue with their play.\u201d\nMaryland Black Bears players fight for the puck along the boards against Wilkes-Barre/Scranton during their North American Hockey League game at Piney Orchard Ice Arena in Odenton, Maryland, on Friday, Nov. 30, 2018 (Photo by Brooks DuBose/Capital News Service)\nWarmuth is hosted by a family in Crofton. Forward and Chicago native Matteo Menotti, 19, stays in Annapolis, and winger Connor Pooley, 20, another Ohioan, stays in Ellicott City.\nThe trio described their billets as comfortable, living in nice houses and regularly taking part in downtime activities like yachting, attended sporting events and flying lessons.\nWhile they\u2019re here, Warmuth, Pooley and Menotti said they are focused on dominating, winning and, above all, having fun playing junior hockey.\n\u201cWe get to chase our dreams,\u201d Pooley said. \u201cWhere a lot of my buddies are headed off to school and they\u2019re gonna be getting a job shortly. \u2026 For us, we get to live the dream for a little bit longer.\u201d\nMylymok has compiled a diverse roster that includes players from 12 different states and others coming from as far away as South Korea, Great Britain and Germany. And while there isn\u2019t a Maryland-based player on the roster, the goal is to bring local players into the fold, Mylymok said, with one caveat: \u201cThey have to be able to play.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Maryland kids but they got to be the right ones,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cI want the guys that represent Maryland in the right way to be here.\u201d\nIn late November, the team took a step toward cultivating local talent by signing an 18-year-old goalie, Andrew Takacs, a native of Dunkirk, to a tender for the 2019-20 season.\nTakacs previously played for a Black Bears affiliate, Team Maryland, and has already suited up for the junior hockey team this season, filling in as a backup for an injured goalie on a weekend road trip.\n\u201cWith Andrew \u2026 we knew what we were getting in terms of character, off-ice work ethic, his maturity. He\u2019s just a kid that represents the local area really well,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cIt was a no-brainer for us.\u201d\nTakacs said he was \u201cbeyond stoked\u201d when he heard the Black Bears had tendered him.\n\u201cThis is the perfect move for me in terms of next year (getting) the development to grow so that I can make it to the Division I level,\u201d Takacs said.\nTakacs attends Gilmour Academy in Ohio, where he will graduate in May. With the Black Bears in the area, Takacs will now have an opportunity to come back and represent his home state.\n\u201cJust to know that you are part of the movement towards making hockey a greater thing in Maryland is really special,\u201d Takacs said. \u201cKids will even start believing \u2018I don\u2019t have to go somewhere else in the country so that I can play high-level hockey.\u2019 \u2026 This is going to put Maryland hockey on the map.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The August shooting at a Madden 19 tournament in Jacksonville that left two people dead and nine wounded continued to linger in gamers\u2019 minds as they traveled to Washington to compete in the Red Bull Conquest Finals this weekend.\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m a little skeptical about events,\u201d Marcus Redmond, who will be competing in the tournament as one of three finalists from Illinois, told Capital News Service. \u201cWhen I go to events, I always pray. I pray right before the event and while I\u2019m at the event. Because you never know (what could happen).\u201d\nThe tournament, which will be held at the Entertainment and Sports Arena, will feature 45 of the top gamers in fighting games like Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, TEKKEN 7 and Guilty Gear Xrd REV2. \nThe shooting has caused competitors and event organizers in the gaming industry to call for tighter security at tournaments. While larger events have guards and metal detectors, others like the venue where the shooting took place have been more lax in their measures, with little to no security at all.\nProfessional video game leagues and tournaments, also known as eSports, are one of the fastest-growing industries in the country. Newzoo, a market research company specializing in the gaming industry, reported $655 million in revenue in 2017 and predicted the industry to cross $1 billion in 2019, according to a February story in Forbes. \nTournaments like the Red Bull Conquest Finals are often held in front of large audiences and feature cash prizes.\nSpectators watch at the Red Bull Conquest Qualifier held at The Garage at Tech Square in Atlanta on Sept. 8, 2018. (Photo courtesy of Red Bull)\nEvents DC hosted 2,000 people for a tournament held in January at the D.C. Armory, and chairman Max Brown said in a statement that the company\u2019s partnership with Red Bull will be \u201canother step forward in cementing D.C. as the capital of eSports.\u201d\nBut other tournaments that do not draw thousands of people have a mixed level quality of security, according to participants. While events organized by major companies have top-notch procedures that include wands and metal detectors, smaller tournaments offer little inspection for spectators and participants.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen both extremes,\u201d Spero Gineros, of Knoxville, Tennessee, who has been competing professionally for 17 years, told CNS. \u201cI\u2019ve seen everything from no security to metal detectors and thoroughly searching bags. Then I\u2019ve seen security where they\u2019re just letting people through. They\u2019re barely wanding people and opening their bags quickly and keeping them moving.\u201d\nGineros, who won first place at Red Bull\u2019s regional tournament in Atlanta, added that the level of security depends on who the host company hires and how much they pay.\nThe winner of Tekken poses for a portrait at the Red Bull Conquest Qualifier held at The Garage at Tech Square in Atlanta on Sept. 8, 2018. (Photo courtesy of Red Bull)\n\u201cYou can pay $500 for the weekend or you can pay $5,000 for the weekend and get more top-notch stuff,\u201d he said.\nStill, the Jacksonville shooting grabbed the attention of organizers for high-profile tournaments. Electronic Arts (E.A.) cancelled the remainder of the Madden tournament, while CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement the company was \u201cdeeply affected by what took place in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature,\u201d Wilson said.\nRedmond said he used to feel like tournaments were a gamer\u2019s safe haven, but the shooting left him \u201cshocked.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we can go to play and you don\u2019t have to worry about any of that,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Thank God,\u2019 because that could have been at an event I was at.\u201d\nHours after the shooting, Joey Cuellar, tournament director for Evolution Championship Series, another eSports event centered on fighting games, tweeted that the tragedy made it clear that \u201cwe need to be more proactive for 2019 and beyond.\u201d\nSecurity was bolstered at EVO\u2019s tournament in Las Vegas this year with undercover law enforcement. Cuellar added in the tweet that there will be metal detectors at all EVO events in 2019.\nRed Bull did not immediately respond to questions about its security measures, but participants in the company\u2019s regional qualifying events said they were pleased with the quality of security. \n\u201cThey were good,\u201d Gineros said. \u201cThey really looked through the bags, and everything seemed good. They seemed like they did a good job.\u201d\nAs far as the quality of security for smaller tournaments, participants still have different experiences. Generos, who has been competing in tournaments since he was 14 years old, said he\u2019s used to a lack of security at events, while Redmon feels the quality of security has gotten more strict since the shooting.\n\u201cThe security varies from event to event because each event has different organizers,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cBut I will say the overall theme is that they have good security.\u201d\n-30-",

The experience of sudden fame varied among competitors, with some adjusting more easily than others to the recognition and success following their appearances on the show.",
    "content": "It was 5 a.m. when Geoff Britten grabbed the thick red rope that hung from the top of the metal structure that was Mt. Midoriyama, his eyes looking skyward at the prize. He had been competing all evening, and the night had finally reached its climax.\nThe instructions were simple: climb the rope to the top of the mountain and Britten, of Olney, Maryland, would be the first American to complete all four stages on NBC\u2019s American version of the popular Japanese obstacle course, \u201cNinja Warrior.\u201d The only problem was that he had to climb the 75-foot long rope in just 30 seconds. \nBritten, then 36, hit the buzzer at the top of the mountain with less than a second left on the clock.\n\u201cIt was definitely something that was very important to me,\u201d Britten, who completed Stage Four in his second season, told Capital News Service. \u201cI trained really hard that year for it. I almost had a feeling I was going to do it.\u201d \nBritten was denied winning the $1 million prize when Isaac Caldiero, the only other competitor to reach Stage Four in Season 7, reached the buzzer faster. Still, it was a unique accomplishment for Britten, a former cameraman. And like climbing Mt. Midoriyama, the weeks and months after Britten\u2019s achievement were unfamiliar territory.\n\u201cNinja Warrior\u201d athletes, also known as ninjas, experience the success and attention from appearing on the American version of the show in different ways, and the way they handle it varies. \nNinja hopefuls send in submission videos and line up for weeks to participate in the show\u2019s city qualifiers. The competitors who make the cut advance to the city finals and then the national finals in Las Vegas. \nMany of the contestants who make one or two appearances on the show return home to a few claps on the back and conversations with friends. Some of the more popular ninjas who regularly return to compete make it an integral part of their lives.\nFor Britten, being the center of attention was an adjustment. He had to deal with consistent recognition from fans of the show congratulating him and wanting to talk. Eventually, it escalated to the point where being out in public became a hindrance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be that person,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who ever wanted to be famous or be in the spotlight. I accept it, I deal with it well. But it\u2019s not something I seek out actively.\u201d\nWhile Britten announced he was taking time off from competing after Season 8, he wasn\u2019t completely done with \u201cNinja Warrior.\u201d Shortly after his announcement, ATS, the company that builds the obstacle courses seen on the show for NBC, reached out to Britten wanting him to be a tester. His background in television and obstacle courses created a good fit.\n\u201cThat was a whole other world to me, and I really enjoyed it,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI got to work with the producers on obstacle difficulty, trying to make the courses doable for a certain amount of people. I think I was a huge asset for them that year.\u201d\nNow, Britten is expanding his knowledge of the sport while also making it more accessible. Working with current and former ninjas, Britten helped start Ninja Nation, a company dedicated to building gyms for ninja hopefuls of all ages.\n\u201cOur goal is to build 100 gyms,\u201d Britten said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to expand access to this growing sport. It\u2019s grown into having multiple leagues, multiple tours. We want to create a professional environment where parents feel safe bringing their kids.\u201d\nThe expansion of the sport has allowed athletes like former gymnast Barclay Stockett, of Dayton, Texas, to thrive after their former athletic careers end. Prior to making her \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d debut in Season 8, Stockett participated in Team Ninja Warrior \u2014 a relay version of the obstacle course \u2014 where she found the community she had been searching for since competing in gymnastics. \n\u201cI found my new sense of place,\u201d Stockett said in a CNS interview. \u201cWhen I quit gymnastics in my senior year of high school, I felt like my athletic career was over. It was like I was in a season of mourning, and it took a long time to find my identity as a person without being an athlete. By the time I found Ninja Warrior\u2026I was really in a healthy mindset to try something new.\u201d\nBarclay Stockett (center) swings from rings at a climbing gym while fellow competitors cheer her on (photo courtesy of John. Cachero)\nStockett was well known in the ninja community before appearing on the show, but she skyrocketed in popularity after Season 9. It\u2019s still a new experience for her, especially when she gets recognized in unlikely places.\n\u201cI was in front of the Louvre (in Paris)\u2026and this couple came up to me and said, \u2018Oh my gosh, you\u2019re Barclay Stockett,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew my name, and I was completely blown away by that.\u201d\nSince April of 2017, Stockett has been working alongside the U.S. Air Force for Alpha Warrior, a company that provides obstacle-based training to branches of the U.S. military. Her work has taken her to \u201caround 30 bases\u201d across the world, including in Italy, Germany and South Korea. \n\u201cIt was so cool because whenever I was looking for something different\u2026I was praying that I would find a job that allowed me to travel, involved a little less time working and allowed athletics and ninja (training) if possible,\u201d she said. \nFor others who compete in \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior,\u201d like Bethesda, Maryland, sprint canoeist Gavin Ross, success on the course doesn\u2019t lead to new careers or inspire them to expand the sport. But it does give them a unique experience that adds to their training for other sports. \nRoss had been a fan of Ninja Warrior since it debuted in Japan before coming to the United States, and competing was always something he wanted to do. But because there weren\u2019t a lot of ninja gyms near him, he wasn\u2019t able to train as much as expected.\nGavin Ross trains trains as a member of the Washington Canoe club. Ross intensified his training when preparing for \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Cathy Kasperbauer)\n\u201cWhen I found out I was going to compete (in the qualifying course), I didn\u2019t do much training specific to ninja for that,\u201d Ross told CNS. \u201cI just started paddling again and started working on my grip strength.\u201d\nRoss added pull ups and dead hangs to his workout. He also placed pool noodles on the bars and handles in the gym that made him work harder to close his hands. But when Ross qualified to compete in Las Vegas for the national finals, he made weekly trips to ninja gyms.\nRoss is a new face to many fans of the show, so he isn\u2019t as recognizable as much as Britten or Stockett yet. He often gets contacted by old high school friends who knew how much he loved the sport. But he does get approached by strangers from time to time who say they know him.\n\u201cThere were a few people who I had no idea who they were,\u201d Ross said with a laugh. \u201cSo I just had to act like I did. They were calling me by name, and when that happen you just assume you\u2019ve met them before.\u201d\nRegardless of the level of success ninjas experience from the show, many believe it is a rewarding part of their lives. \nBritten was reminded of that after failing on Stage One in Season 8. He emerged from the water with a smile on his face and said two words: \u201cEverybody falls.\u201d He received more than 1,000 letters from parents thanking him for what he said. \n\u201cI got more kudos falling with grace than I did doing well with style,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI thought it was indicative of why \u2018Ninja Warrior\u2019 is so great. People look at it as a physical challenge, but it\u2019s also a role model and great teacher.\u201d",

Before being hired, I worked for NBC Sports Philadelphia (formerly CSN) as their social media manager and before that I worked / interned at a handful of smaller agencies in Philadelphia,\u201d said Philadelphia 76ers Senior Social Media Manager Kurt Gies.\n\u201cI started my career in managing social media and digital channels for a group of local radio stations here in Indianapolis. Then, I moved to Pacers Sports & Entertainment to run social media for Bankers Life Fieldhouse and the WNBA team, Indiana Fever. After a year in that position, I transitioned to Pacers social media, where I\u2019ve been running our accounts for five years,\u201d said Indiana Pacers Director of Digital Marketing Celeste Ballou.\nWhat is it like interacting with another team of Twitter?\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun \u2013 a lot of the NBA social people know each other and there are a lot of great people doing great things around league. Fans always like it when the teams interact.\u201d said Detroit Pistons Social Media Director Doug Wernert.\n\u201cMost of our interactions are spur of the moment and have to do with what\u2019s happening in the game.

You never know what you\u2019re going to capture and it was cool that I was in the right place at the right time to capture a legend doing that,\u201d said Social Media Producer Amara Baptist for the Memphis Grizzlies when this interview was conducted in April.

Which teams do you not converse with?\n\u201cTypically I don\u2019t start anything with other teams but if they tweet at me I\u2019ll often respond, so it really isn\u2019t a matter of who I will/won\u2019t respond to, just mostly whether the topic is a good fit and we can maintain our brand voice throughout the conversation,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cThey all have their different styles & it\u2019s really fun to talk to them all, but I personally like to interact with the Jazz, Trail Blazers, Hawks & Kings!\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nWhat is the typical process of creating a tweet for your team?\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of all the tweets so I have a content plan for what we want to communicate. I have access to photos and videos and templates and assets from our creative team and then I draft the copy (or use copy if it\u2019s provided) and send it out,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cIt depends on the situation, but in-game usually it\u2019s going with the flow of what is happening in the game. I\u2019ll live tweet plays, use gifs if one of our players starts to score a lot of points & post video highlights. On non-game days, we have sponsored content & other off-day content that we need to post so I\u2019ll go from there depending on what is on my schedule,\u201d said Baptist, formerly of the Grizzlies.\nHow is the account typically managed? How many people run the account? How does a tweet get approved?\n\u201cThe account is mainly me and one other person that also helps with our Web site. There\u2019s not really an approval process \u2013 I may run something by our PR staff or Community Relations staff or partnerships team depending on what it is, but for the most part, I\u2019m the approval process,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cI am the only one who is running our account currently. I usually do not need to have a tweet approved because I have the trust of the organization. If I do have a question about a tweet that is borderline risky however, I\u2019ll text my boss & get their opinion before I post it,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nDoes your account have a particular style or personality?\n\u201cWe just try to be reflective of our brand but have a little more fun with it. As a very traditional/historic brand, one of my main challenges is toying the line between being youthful and fun and a little risky with maintaining our championship-caliber attitude. We won\u2019t do cheesy gimmicks because our audience sees right through that and frankly is more interested in the basketball component than smaller market teams might be dealing with,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve traditionally been a bit more straight-laced with less of a personality in past years and that was mainly dictated by our Basketball department. With changes in the front office in the past year, we\u2019ve been able to open up and have a bit more fun, which is the whole point of social media. We use our account to share that of our midwestern pride, embracing the underdog persona, and toe the line of being sarcastic/playful. We know there are teams that are far more edgy than us, but that\u2019s not the persona that we\u2019re seeking for the Pacers,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.\nHow do you think the culture of NBA Twitter has evolved in the last few years? Does how other teams act impact how your account acts?\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost become a culture in itself, constantly pushing the envelope and finding new ways to keep it fresh and interesting. I always am looking at other teams to see what they\u2019re doing that\u2019s new that we could consider adopting or looking for ideas on ways to improve what we\u2019re already doing,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cThe culture of NBA Twitter has evolved so much within the last few years. It is the leader in how people find out information about the team, what happened in a game & you can always count on teams to be the first to comment on a trending topic with something witty. It will only continue to grow as technology changes & evolves,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\n\u201cThe shift has gone from live tweeting play by play to being more of a second screen or the feeling of watching the game with a fellow fan. We still post top highlights but we\u2019ve moved away from play-by-play on our Twitter account. We definitely watch others teams to see what kind of content or even just copy is working for them and see where we can use it ourselves. We also get daily reports with rankings and interactions across social channels so we can see how we\u2019re performing, compared to teams across the league,\u201d said Ballou for the Pacers.\nWhat do you think makes the NBA Twitter community so fun and popular?\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. The teams have fun with it and try to relate to their fan base on personal levels. I like adopting the voice of the fan as the voice of the team and I think that helps keep the community so fun and popular,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cIt seems like fans of the NBA and the players themselves are definitely the most vocal on social media, so when you\u2019re watching a game & tweeting about it, it feels like you are with a bunch of your friends at a sports bar watching it together. Fans really feel like they are a part of the conversation & Twitter gives them a direct way to contact their favorite teams & athletes,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nDoes how your team performs impact how you tweet?\n\u201cIn some aspects, definitely. Being self-aware is a big part of social media and while there\u2019s things to highlight during poor performances, over-tweeting could and usual does receive backlash from followers,\u201d said Gies, of the 76ers.\n\u201cCertainly. There will be subtle differences between how we tweet a huge loss, a narrow win, to a come-from-behind victory. The tone will be a bit different if we\u2019re on a 6-game losing streak compared to a win streak. Sometimes, our job is to give fans hope or remind them why they\u2019re fans of the team. Sometimes we have to acknowledge that the team didn\u2019t meet expectations, and other times we have a different kind of confidence and build our fan base even further by highlighting things that are going really well,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.\nHow does tweeting change in-season versus out-of-season?\n\u201cWithout the games, the focus goes more to the draft, free agency, Summer League and any other moves we might make. We don\u2019t have as much access to players so we have to look for other ways to tell our story,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cWith no games in the offseason, we need to come up with compelling content that our fans will enjoy that is outside of the typical live tweeting of games. During the season there is constant content every day i.e. game highlights, game previews & recaps, practice content, twitter takeovers etc. We have a lot more access to do things with players during the season as well,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nWhat are your plans for the future of your account? \n\u201cAt this point we just want to make sure we\u2019re constantly looking ahead and keeping the account fun and light. We\u2019re going through a transition internally this year/in the next few years on really forming a voice/identity, something organizationally we didn\u2019t put much of a focus on previously,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cWe definitely think we\u2019ll push a more playful attitude as we continue. This season was the first step for us, and we look to further establish our voice while also creating new and unique content that our fans may not even expect. We have the greatest access to our players and I hope to continue to find fun angles to share their stories and personalities with our fans,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]",

The two emoji that got an NBA social media manager fired. \nIn the first round of the 2015 Western Conference playoffs, the Houston Rockets were on the brink of eliminating the Dallas Mavericks when Rockets social media manager Chad Shanks sent this tweet.\n(screenshot via thebiglead.com)\nHe was fired, sending a message that NBA team Twitter managers could go too far. \u00a0\u00a0\n2. The clever way the Atlanta Hawks tracked a winning streak.\nIn 2015, the Hawks went on an epic run of 19 wins in a row, the fifth longest winning streak in NBA history at the time. At some point during the run, they began to add a W to their name on Twitter for each win.\n(screenshot via SBNation.com)\nBy the time the Hawks hit 19, they had had already surpassed the character limit for a Twitter account name that was in place at the time.\n3. The Sacramento Kings gave the Cleveland Cavaliers a new logo.\nAfter defeating the Cavaliers in overtime in January 2017, the Sacramento Kings rubbed it in with a photoshopped version of the Cavs logo that replaced the traditional \u201cC\u201d with an \u201cL\u201d.\n\nThis one's for the Land\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GiJ2wSEoOZ\n\u2014 Sacramen2 Kings (@SacramentoKings) January 26, 2017\n\n4.\u00a0The Twitter fight that led the league to crack down on trash talk.\nAfter the Portland Trail Blazers poked fun at Memphis Grizzlies forward Chandler Parsons with a GIF of an airball he put up during a January 2017 game between the two teams, he taunted the Trail Blazers for their poor performance with this Tweet. \n\ngood luck in the lottery show this year\u270a?\n\u2014 Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons) January 28, 2017\n\nThat led to this back and forth between Parsons and Trail Blazers player C. J. McCollum.\n\nstop it. Technically, I hit the lottery.\n\u2014 Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons) January 28, 2017\n\nIn response, the league issued a memo urging teams to tone down social media trash talk, according to ESPN. \n5. A Twitter DM conversation leads to an NBA social media manager and a fan getting engaged. \u00a0\nShabaz Khan was working as a social media manager for the Kings, when he sent a DM (direct message) to a fan asking for her permission to use this picture on the Kings\u2019 social platforms. \n\n4 days. #SacramentoProud (Photo via @ferheeeen) pic.twitter.com/Kq6Dkk8OZI\n\u2014 Sacramen2 Kings (@SacramentoKings) October 24, 2015\n\nTwo years later, Kahn tweeted that the two were engaged. \n\nWhen you take the \"engaging with fans\" part of the job a bit too seriously\u2026 ? @ferheeeen #WeMetOnTwitter pic.twitter.com/5Q6BlkTaYz\n\u2014 Shahbaz Khan (@ShahbazMKhan) July 30, 2017\n\n6.\u00a0The time the Hawks and Kings became best friends.\nShortly after the NBA issued a memo in 2017 urging teams to avoid trash talk and use social media for \u201cfun, light hearted banter,\u201d according to ESPN, the Hawks and Kings decided to be extra friendly to each other during a game. \n\n pic.twitter.com/I5cOg47d5i\n\u2014 Sacramen2 Kings (@SacramentoKings) February 11, 2017\n\n7.\u00a0When the 76ers used old-school ASCII art and a video to lobby for a spot for Joel Embiid on the All-Star Team. \nThis kind of speaks for itself.\n\n(\u2022_\u2022)  Joel /    \n (\u2022_\u2022)  Embiid  /     pic.twitter.com/O632dXQtxi\n\u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) January 12, 2017\n\n8.\u00a0The hashtag game between NBA teams takes a weird turn. \nIn March 2016, several NBA teams joined forces to come with the best puns they could that related to their teams. The categories were based on categories such as #NBAVegetables and #NBASitcoms.\n\n.@MNTimberwolves @Sixers @dallasmavs @Suns @ATLHawks @trailblazers @chicagobulls Everybody Loves Draymond #NBASitcoms pic.twitter.com/qkNj2kruGy\n\u2014 Golden State Warriors (@warriors) July 24, 2014\n\n\n.@ATLHawks @Sixers @warriors @trailblazers Gerald Green Beans #NBAVegetables \nSee what you made us do.\n\u2014 Phoen1x \u0160uns (@Suns) July 24, 2014\n\nTwo of the highlights: Everybody Loves Draymond by the Warriors and Gerald Green Beans by the Suns.\nFor more on the history of NBA Twitter, check out Chad Shanks podcast Sports-ish and Complex\u2019s annual ranking of the NBA Twitter accounts.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]",

But the Hawks were far less dedicated to the Hornets. About one in eight of the Hawks\u2019 conversations with other NBA teams involved the Hornets. \nTo gather the conversation data, we scraped Twitter, capturing any chain of replies involving at least two or more official NBA team Twitter accounts.\n(The web scraper in action. Check out the code here.)\nThe Hawks, along with the Portland Trail Blazers, were the two most social teams. The Knicks and Thunder were among the least social and generally became involved in a conversation only when sparked by a more social team.\n\nMany of the conversational relationships we found on Twitter make sense. A lot of team back-and-forth happens during games, so teams in the same conference tend to talk to each other more.\nHowever, not every relationship makes as much sense. The Hawks and the Suns had more conversations with each other than any two teams, but they play in different conferences.\n\n.@ATLHawks @dallasmavs You're welcome to drop by any time.

Coach Scott Brooks criticizes the team's selfish play, particularly in a disappointing loss to the Atlanta Hawks.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With the NBA playoffs upon them, the Washington Wizards have been struggling to find answers to issues that have plagued the team all season.\nThe team has lost seven of its last 10 games and several of those losses were against lackluster teams with under-.500 records, including the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons.\nAfter a disappointing loss to the struggling Atlanta Hawks on Friday, Wizards head coach Scott Brooks heavily criticized the team for its lack of ball movement and creativity.\n\u201cSelfish basketball is no fun to coach, it\u2019s no fun to play with, and it\u2019s no fun to watch. We\u2019re a selfish basketball team right now,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to share the basketball, you can\u2019t just say \u2018John\u2019s not here.\u2019 John\u2019s here, it doesn\u2019t matter. We still got to play the right way.\u201d\nAll-star point guard John Wall didn\u2019t suit up against the Hawks and his absence was evident throughout the game. Center Marcin Gortat, who has averaged two assists this season, was the Wizards\u2019 assist leader that night with only four total assists.\nAlthough the team struggled to move the ball well against the Hawks, it hasn\u2019t been a consistent problem this season. The team\u2019s frustrating loss to Atlanta is really an outlier, because the Wizards have actually moved the ball well recently.\nOver the last five games, where the Wizards have gone 1-4, the team has averaged 27.2 assists per game, the seventh-best assist rate in the league. The team has also averaged an impressive 68.7 assist percentage, the third-best percentage in the NBA during that span.\nIt\u2019s evident that the Wizards are actually doing an efficient job of moving the ball lately, as nearly 70 percent of all their field goals have come right after a pass. However, the real problem for the team heading into the playoffs isn\u2019t necessarily ball movement, it\u2019s the turnovers that come from all those passes.\nOver the last five games, the Wizards have averaged 16.2 turnovers per game, the fourth- highest turnover rate in the league. The team has also averaged a 16.6 turnover percentage, the third-highest rate during this span. This means that the team is turning over the ball roughly 17 times per 100 plays.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of moving the ball; looking for the extra pass, looking for the right pass, saving the home run passes,\u201d Wizards small forward Otto Porter Jr. said Friday. \u201cTurnovers are putting us in a bad position.\u201d\nBrooks also recognized a need for better effort from the team on defense. He mentioned that the Wizards made several mistakes against the Hawks that led to wide-open shots around the perimeter and in the paint.\nThe Wizards haven\u2019t been a great defensive team this year, but stats show they\u2019ve been regressing on the defensive side recently.\nThe team has allowed 111.2 points per 100 possessions over its last five games, the sixth-worst defensive rating in the league over that span. They\u2019ve also allowed 19.2 points off of turnovers, which is the fifth-highest rate in the league.\nWith the playoffs approaching, the team has to find a way to cut down on turnovers and play sharper defense on and off the ball. Players will have to step up on both ends of the court for the team to make a strong playoff run.\nWith a potential first-round playoff matchup against the red-hot Toronto Raptors or the resilient Boston Celtics, there\u2019s really no room for mistakes and the Wizards\u2019 players know it.\n\u201cWe are supposed to be playing great for the playoffs, improving in all things and now we\u2019re just struggling all over the floor,\u201d backup point guard Tomas Satoransky said after Friday\u2019s game. \u201cWe have to really change it quickly.\u201d",

This means that nearly 70 percent of every field goal the Wizards made during that stretch came right after a pass.\nThe Wizards also have the fifth-highest assist per game rate this season, with a total of 24.6 assists per game as a team. In their last 15 games, however, the Wizards have passed the ball well enough for the third-best rate in the league, with 28.1 assists per game.\nThese are impressive statistics considering that Wall, the team\u2019s primary ball handler, has missed significant time this season and yet still leads the team in total assists.\nThe Wizards have managed to keep up this high-assist total without the all-star guard thanks to improved passing from both shooting guard Bradley Beal and Tomas Satoransky, who has taken up the role as the team\u2019s starting point guard in Wall\u2019s absence.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to always find the open man, trying to play smart, trying to move the ball,\u201d Satoransky told Capital News Service after the Wizards\u2019 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on Brad so we try to cut, looking for the open man.\u201d\nWhile assists have gone up without Wall, the team has also been turning over the ball excessively. In their last 15 games, the Wizards have averaged 15.5 turnovers a game, the fifth-highest total in the league during that span.\nAlthough the Wizards picked up a narrow 117-113 win over the Miami Heat in overtime Tuesday night, the team allowed 19 turnovers that turned into 29 points for the Heat. It was a close game that the Wizards could have won in regulation had they not turned over the ball so much.\nThe team\u2019s struggle with turnovers has resulted in easier offense for opposing teams this season. During their last 15 games, the Wizards have allowed opponents to score 20.5 points off of turnovers, the second-highest total in the league behind the struggling Memphis Grizzlies.\n\u201cWe just need to be simple,\u201d Beal said in a statement. \u201cSometimes we try to make the home-run play or a play that\u2019s not there to get the assist, or whatever it may be.\u201d\nPart of the problem with the turnovers is that Wall was usually the player who took the ball up the court. He helped determine the flow of the offense, which is something Beal and Satoransky have been unable to do as effectively as Wall.\nWith the all-star guard still weeks away from returning to action, the Wizards will have to find a solution to their turnover problem soon. There are only 17 regular season games left and these games will help determine seeding when the playoffs start.\n\u201cAll we have to do is move the ball, share it and shoot it,\u201d Beal said. \u201cShoot it when you\u2019re open and if you don\u2019t shoot it when you\u2019re open, that\u2019s when the turnovers are allowed to happen.\u201d",

Walter E. \u201cTed\u201d Carter.\nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the one word to describe the ability to play an outdoor game at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium is \u201ciconic.\u201d\n\u201cBeing able to work with the Naval Academy as closely as we have to bring this game here has really been a fantastic partnership,\u201d Daly said.\nThe task of transforming the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium football field into a hockey rink belongs to the NHL\u2019s senior manager of facilities operations and hockey operations, Derek King. He explained that to build the rink, he and his 16 ice crew members will take what the weather gives them over the next week and a half.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll adjust our schedule,\u201d said King. \u201cSo if we\u2019re going to get 70-degree weather during the day, we won\u2019t do any ice-making during the day.\u201d\nThe ice-making process is scheduled to start Thursday night, according to Jeff Day, the coordinator for event communications and player development at the National Hockey League.\nFor the players, former Capitals forward Peter Bondra said, they\u2019ll find ways to adjust to the elements.\n\u201cThe weather might be (an) issue, but the guys are professionals,\u201d Bondra said. \u201cThere are trainers, equipment managers to help the players to sort of adjust to the conditions.\u201d\nBondra, who played for the Caps from 1990 until 2004, will participate in an alumni fantasy game on the rink the following day.\n\nVideo by Steven Dilsizian\nMaking a pro-level hockey rink outdoors in what has been a string of spring-like days in the region can be a challenge, but the NHL used its technical expertise to make an outdoor game possible in Los Angeles.\nTo build a rink that complies with NHL standards, King and his construction crew use a mobile refrigeration unit and rink system that removes as much heat from the ice surface as possible.\nThat unit shunts nearly 3,000 gallons of coolant into custom-made trays that are located under the rink, keeping it at the 22-degree Fahrenheit temperature needed to maintain the playing surface.\nAfter the boards and brackets are put into place and the right surface temperature is reached, water is misted onto the surface in layers, adding up to two inches of ice. Carter called that ice-building process a \u201ctechnological marvel.\u201d\nRegardless of the temperature, this is a game players get excited for, Bondra said.\n\u201cIf I was a player, I would definitely circle the calendar,\u201d he said.\nAdded to the excitement of playing outdoors and playing at a military academy is a budding rivalry between the two teams, Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said.\n\u201cToronto\u2019s in the East and it\u2019s a good rivalry now since we had a playoff series with them last year,\u201d said MacLellan.\nIn tight races in both the Metropolitan and Atlantic divisions, the Capitals and the Maple Leafs each hope to come away with two standings points to gain separation from rivals.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the 2018 Major League Soccer season set to start early next month, D.C. United will play its home opener against the Houston Dynamo at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Montgomery County.\nThe change of scene was necessary because the team won\u2019t have its real home field to play on until July 14, when its new soccer stadium, Audi Field, makes its debut.\nThe Washington Post reported that the team originally had requested to play all 17 home matches in Audi Field, but the MLS rejected the proposal. Instead, the team will play a pair of home matches locally in Maryland before playing in their new stadium.\nThe team\u2019s first home match will be against the Houston Dynamo on March 17 at the SoccerPlex in Boyds, Maryland, at 1:30 p.m.\nKeith Lenert, the director of operations at the SoccerPlex, said the venue has hosted D.C. United games in the past, but never a regular season match.\n\u201cWe hosted D.C. United-Chicago Fire and D.C. United-Columbus Crew, but those were in the U.S. Open Cup competition,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cThis will be the first MLS, officially sanctioned match that we will have hosted.\u201d\nThe Maryland SoccerPlex has been the home venue for the Washington Spirit, a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team, since 2013. The Spirit are scheduled to play 12 games at the SoccerPlex this upcoming NWSL season.\nOne of the concerns heading into the game is the 5,000-seat capacity of the SoccerPlex. Audi Field is set to have a capacity of 20,000 and the team\u2019s former home, RFK Stadium in Washington, had a capacity for about 46,000 people.\n\u201cThere\u2019s permanent seating for 3,200 and then we open up a hillside that will accommodate another 1,000 or so,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cThen there\u2019s some standing room because it\u2019s such a small, bowl-type environment.\u201d\nLast season, D.C. United had an average attendance of 17,904 per game. Given the limited capacity at the Maryland SoccerPlex, the event could very well sell out.\nThat could pose multiple issues for the venue.\nThe team and facility have made efforts to ensure the infrastructure and amenities at the complex are up to par for an official MLS match. Lenert said there are some amenities that D.C. United will bring in specifically for the game.\nLindsay Simpson, D.C. United\u2019s director of media and communication, offered details.\n\u201cWe are adding the necessary infrastructure to support our match broadcast as well as our pre- and post-match coverage,\u201d Simpson said \u201cThere will also be infrastructure additions to accommodate the crowd size, including security, restrooms, concessions and any other necessary areas.\u201d\nIn addition to the D.C. United game, the MSI Cherry Blossom Classic soccer tournament and the MVSA Volleyball Tournament also will be going on around the SoccerPlex and in the nearby Discovery Sports Center. According to Lenert, the team and venue have taken steps to address the possible safety and parking concerns for the various events that day.\n\u201cThe biggest adjustment is probably planning for overflow parking,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cWe have a earthen area on site here at the park that we will use periodically for large-scale events that require overflow parking.\u201d\nHe said the venue has worked closely with the Maryland-National Capital Park Police to coordinate appropriate levels of police detail to support both traffic and the stadium crowd.\nD.C. United\u2019s second home game will be played at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, on Saturday, April 14, against the Columbus Crew SC.\nD.C. United starts its 2018 season on the road against Orlando City SC on March 3.",

    "content": "BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 The Philadelphia fans, who made up the majority of the 67,612 spectators at U.S. Bank Stadium for Super Bowl LII on Sunday night, knew their cheers could\u2019ve been short-lived after the Eagles took the lead with just under two and a half minutes remaining.\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who\u2019s led 42 fourth-quarter comebacks, was taking the field with 2:21 left after Eagles tight end Zach Ertz\u2019s touchdown. In last year\u2019s Super Bowl, Brady guided the Patriots back from a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons for his fifth championship title.\nBut on the second play of that New England drive, defensive end Brandon Graham stripped the ball from Brady, and defense end Derek Barnett recovered, handing their offense the ball on New England\u2019s 31-yard line.\nThe Philadelphia faithful let out a sigh of relief with its loudest cheer of the game, while many of the Eagles players stormed the field, acting like they had all but sealed their upset victory.\nThe Eagles extended their lead to eight points after Jake Elliott\u2019s field goal, and the Philadelphia defense, which allowed the fourth-fewest yards per game in the NFL regular season, again stopped the Patriots on their final possession to seal the Eagles\u2019 first-ever Super Bowl with a 41-33 victory.\n\u201cIf you had asked me at the beginning of the season how this all would have went or unfolded,\u201d Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a story any better.\u201d\nPhiladelphia held a 12-point halftime edge, but the Patriots\u2019 rally seemed all but certain with Brady under center. The teams traded touchdowns to begin the third quarter, and after Brady found wide receiver Chris Hogan for a 26-yard touchdown, the Eagles settled for a field goal. The Patriots responded with 10-play touchdown drive that gave them a 33-32 edge.\nYet Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles, who replaced the injured Carson Wentz in December, displayed the poise that helped him lead the Eagles to wins in all five of the full games he played this year. The 2018 Super Bowl MVP, who signed back with Philadelphia in March after playing elsewhere the previous two seasons, powered a 14-play drive, capped by his 11-yard touchdown pass to Ertz.\nOn a 4th-and-one on the Eagles\u2019 own 45-yard line during that drive, Ertz caught a two-yard pass, one of the many bold plays second-year head coach Doug Pederson presented Sunday against Bill Belichick, one of the great coaches of all time. Foles also caught a touchdown pass from tight end Trey Burton on a 4th-and-one with 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter.\n\u201c[Pederson] said it from the beginning: \u2018We\u2019re going to be aggressive,\u2019\u201d Philadelphia wide receiver Torrey Smith said. \u201cIt means the world that he trusts us in those situations.\u201d\nWhile New England\u2019s offense heavily relied on Brady, who threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns, the Eagles offense was more versatile by switching between pass and run plays. Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Four different Eagles caught receiving touchdowns.\n\u201cThe big thing that helped me,\u201d Foles said, \u201cwas knowing that I didn\u2019t have to be Superman.\u201d\nThe Eagles have prided themselves as underdogs since Wentz\u2019s injury, a mindset Ertz said helped the team bond. Philadelphia was projected to lose all its playoff games, and players wore dog masks following their first two victories.\nSo, after Foles led the go-ahead drive, the Eagles defensive players encouraged each other to take advantage of the moment they had desired. They knew Brady would hold onto the ball for a long time, Graham said, since he had been throughout the game. The group that Smith called the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the team came through.\nThen, after Elliott\u2019s field goal, Brady threw 3-for-8 on the Patriots\u2019 final drive, only moving to the New England 49-yard line before time expired. The Eagles players rushed the field, and they roamed freely for as long as they pleased this time, soaking in the confetti falling from the ceiling and indulging in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation Philadelphia supporters had long waited for.\n\u201cPhilly is crazy right now,\u201d Philadelphia defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cThe city probably won\u2019t sleep for a week.\u201d",

Despite not receiving initial college attention, Hollins will play in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots, showcasing his unique journey and success.",
    "content": "BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 As a senior playing for the Wootton High School football team in Rockville, Maryland, wide receiver Mack Hollins dressed in a suit and tie and carried a briefcase around school everyday. All of his friends questioned his attire, but they became used to it after two weeks.\n\u201cYou dress for the job you want,\u201d Hollins told Capital News Service, \u201cnot the job you have.\u201d\nHollins has continued those quirky actions as a rookie wide receiver with the Philadelphia Eagles. \nHe played with a Rubik\u2019s Cube to stay calm when speaking with Super Bowl media this week. He always rides his bike to the NovaCare Complex for Eagles practice, and he\u2019s encouraged his teammates to buy Nintendo Switches so they can play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with him.\nHollins\u2019 different personality correlates with the unusual path he took to the NFL. \nWootton is best known for its academics, rarely producing Division I college talent. \nHollins didn\u2019t receive any Division I scholarship offers out of high school or after his year at Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill admitted Hollins, where he walked onto the team and stood out on special teams.\nAfter completing his roundabout route to the NFL, Hollins and the Eagles will play in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots on Sunday at 6:30 p.m.\n\u201cMack was a home run,\u201d said Marcus Berry, North Carolina\u2019s former director of player personnel. \u201cIn the nine years I\u2019ve done it, he\u2019s one of the highlights of my career. I\u2019m not surprised by any of his success.\u201d\nHollins didn\u2019t play his junior year at Wootton for an incident he didn\u2019t specify, which Wootton coach Eddie Tolliver said prevented him from receiving college attention. \nWootton hasn\u2019t groomed another NFL player in Tolliver\u2019s seven years leading the program, so college scouts didn\u2019t spend much time watching Wootton\u2019s games.\nBut Hollins\u2019 dad, Richard, connected with Berry through their ties of playing football at West Virginia University. Hollins\u2019 speed impressed Berry, and he encouraged the Rockville native to attend preparatory school for a year to gain more exposure.\nHollins learned how to long snap at Fork Union, just so he could get on the field at some position. \nStill, Hollins didn\u2019t receive any Division I offers after his season at Fork Union. He emailed about 100 colleges, and while some of the coach\u2019s secretaries responded, Berry was one of the only coaches to respond himself.\nHollins attended North Carolina, and Berry, still impressed by Hollins\u2019 upside, did everything he could to help Hollins make the team.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be in college just reading books,\u201d Hollins said, \u201cand not doing something with my extra time.\u201d\nLarry Fedora had just taken over as head coach of the Tar Heels, and he wanted 12 speedy wide receivers to fit his multi-tempo, no-huddle spread offense, and there was only one roster spot available.\nBerry stood up for Hollins at the team\u2019s pair of meetings to decide who to pick for that final spot. \nBerry guaranteed Fedora that Hollins would be on scholarship by the end of his scholarship year, and Hollins gave himself two years to earn a scholarship because of the burden of paying out-of-state tuition.\nNorth Carolina chose Hollins, and Berry\u2019s prediction panned out, as the Tar Heels placed Hollins on scholarship entering his sophomore year.\n\u201cWhen he first got here, I didn\u2019t know if he could catch. I didn\u2019t know he could tackle,\u201d North Carolina strength and conditioning coach Lou Hernandez said. \u201cBut watching him run, it was like, \u2018We got to find something for this guy to do.\u2019\u201d\nHollins separated himself with his work ethic. He won every sprinting drill, and after finishing his conditioning training, he would run on the treadmill. \nSometimes, he would go through the conditioning drills twice, when some players couldn\u2019t even finish their first round.\nCoaches worried about Hollins\u2019 ability to catch, so he spent 30 extra minutes before and after practices working on the JUGS machine.\nBehind Hollins\u2019 6-foot, 4-inch frame and agility, Berry said, he developed into one of the best special teams players in North Carolina history. He was one of the team\u2019s top two receivers by his sophomore year, and he led the country with 24.8 yards per reception his junior season.\nThe Eagles selected Hollins in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\u201cThe other guys on the team were like, \u2018Man, you have to chill out. You\u2019re not going to make it through,\u2019\u201d Berry said. \u201cHe would literally win every race. It just got to the point where it was like, \u2018Just do what Mack does.\u2019\u201d\nHollins still visits Wootton when he\u2019s home, serving as a mentor for the current players, a role he didn\u2019t have as a high schooler since no other Wootton player was in the NFL. \nThe players were nervous to talk with Hollins before he started working out at the school often between graduating from North Carolina and reporting to Eagles training camp.\n\u201cHe inspires me,\u201d Wootton wide receiver Elijah Trent said, \u201cbecause he never lost sight of his dream.\u201d \nHollins has made his biggest difference in the NFL on special teams, although Philadelphia special teams coordinator Dave Fipp said it usually takes about three years to become a great special teams performer. \nHollins has served a defined role as a big-play wideout in a crowded receivers corps, recording 16 catches for 226 yards.\nEagles safety Jaylen Watkins said Hollins reads defenders\u2019 hand placements in practices and often makes slight adjustments on his routes to get open.\n\u201cSome NFL players are flashy,\u201d Watkins said, \u201cbut Mack likes what he likes.\u201d\nEven as Hollins cracks jokes throughout meetings, his teammates and coaches respect the journey that has led him to the Super Bowl.\n\u201cYou can just tell the way he runs routes he\u2019s a smart guy,\u201d Eagles safety Rodney McLeod said. \u201cHe\u2019s not overly fast or anything, but he\u2019s very crafty and finds a way to get open. He\u2019s going to be around here for a long time.\u201d",

    "summary": "Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots' coach, has maintained his connection to lacrosse throughout his 42-year NFL career, frequently visiting Johns Hopkins University's practices and games. His deep passion for the sport dates back to his college days at Wesleyan University, where he played and assisted in coaching.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2013 The Johns Hopkins men\u2019s lacrosse players were starstruck.  \nNew England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was visiting their practice in Baltimore for the first time in the spring of 2007, and most of the players choked up when saying hello to one of the best-ever NFL coaches.\n\nSince then, the players who have rotated through the program have become comfortable around Belichick. Belichick started visiting Johns Hopkins\u2019 practices and games about three times per year after developing a friendship with coach Dave Pietramala in 2006, learning all of the players\u2019 names and chatting with them individually. \nAn Annapolis, Maryland, native, Belichick played lacrosse and football at Wesleyan University. While he\u2019s paved a legacy in coaching football and will try for his sixth Super Bowl on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. against the Philadelphia Eagles, Belichick has maintained his connection to lacrosse throughout his 42-year coaching career.\n\u201cThere is a great passion that he has for the sport,\u201d Pietramala told Capital News Service. \u201cHe\u2019s very, very knowledgeable of the game.\u201d\nThe offices of former Wesleyan University Athletic Director John Biddiscombe and men\u2019s lacrosse coach Terry Jackson were next to each other when Belichick played at the college in the early 1970s Belichick would usually be in Jackson\u2019s office when Biddiscombe arrived at work around 8 a.m., helping create practice plans and strategies for upcoming games. \nBelichick was one of the best players on his Division III squad. He played at Annapolis High School, as well as at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts during a postgraduate year.\nBiddiscombe said Belichick acted as an assistant coach, examining the game similarly to the way he broke down plays as a center and tight end for the football team. The 5-foot, 11-inch defenseman asked the coaching staff about defensive changes and suggested adjustments if the opposing offense set up its formation differently than the Cardinals planned.\n\u201cHis talent, particularly his size limitations,\u201d Biddiscombe said, \u201creally stirred him more to lacrosse.\u201d\nPatriots wide receiver Chris Hogan, who played lacrosse at Pennsylvania State University, said hand-eye coordination, physicality and stamina are the main skills that correlate between football and lacrosse. \nHogan said Belichick brought up his lacrosse background when the Ramapo, New Jersey, native signed with New England in 2016.\n\u201cAny opportunity that we have to promote a game we both love,\u201d Hogan told a small group of reporters here, \u201cit\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d\nWhen he coached with the Detroit Lions in 1976-77, Belichick also helped coach lacrosse during the spring at a local prep school.\nBelichick often played lacrosse in his backyard with his three children, Steve, Amanda and Brian, when they were growing up. He was available often during spring lacrosse season because it didn\u2019t overlap with football. \nAll three of Belichick\u2019s children played in college, and Amanda Belichick is now Holy Cross\u2019 women\u2019s lacrosse coach.\nBelichick\u2019s children\u2019s passion for lacrosse grew when Bill Belichick joined the Patriots as an assistant head coach and defensive backs coach in 1996, and his family moved from Cleveland to Boston, where lacrosse was more popular. \nOne year later, the Belichick family moved near Long Island, New York, when Belichick took the same job with the New York Jets, and his children competed against some of the top youth lacrosse players in the country.\n\u201cEvery coach has great points, but at the end of the day for me, what my dad said was the bottom line,\u201d Steve Belichick, who\u2019s now the Patriots safeties coach, said in an interview with reporters. \u201cHe has a good track record.\u201d\nLacrosse is one of the main ways Bill Belichick bonded with his children, and they continue to bounce ideas off each other now, as Brian Belichick joined his father and brother on New England\u2019s staff as a coaching assistant in June.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly helps me give a good perspective on things (Steve) sees as an assistant coach,\u201d Bill Belichick said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly a lot closer to the age of the players than I am. He has a good feel for things \u2026 I might need to address that I missed because I don\u2019t see the point of view that he sees.\u201d\nBill Belichick, who occasionally wears Johns Hopkins gear, discussed his Baltimore roots with Pietramala after Johns Hopkins won the 2005 national championship. \nSince then, the pair has visited each other\u2019s practices, discussed the top professional and college lacrosse players and shared lacrosse strategy \nWith the 2017 NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse Final Four in Gillette Stadium, Belichick practiced alongside the teams and delivered a speech to Ohio State. Belichick often also presents motivational speeches to the Johns Hopkins squad when he visits. \nOne of Bill Belichick\u2019s favorite memories came about a decade ago, Pietramala said, when he warmed up former goalkeeper Jesse Schwartzman. \nSchwartzman couldn\u2019t tell if Bill Belichick, a righty, was right- or left-handed when he took shots because he was so skillful with his stick.\nMoments like those are one of the reasons Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said lacrosse is one of the four things that make Belichick smile.\n\u201cI marvel that he still has that burning passion for lacrosse,\u201d Biddiscombe said.",

His natural quickness helped him become one of Maryland\u2019s top football recruits and has been a key factor in his NFL success, contributing to the Eagles' strong defensive performance leading into the Super Bowl.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 Facing Gwynn Park High School as a cornerback for Potomac High School in 2010, Ronald Darby slipped and fell to the ground. \nA Gwynn Park receiver was caught up in a scrum of defenders.  Darby figured his foe would get tackled, so he did not immediately get up.\n\nThen the opposing wideout broke away with a clear field to the end zone. Darby, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, stood up and sprinted. He caught the receiver 40 yards down field and stripped the ball loose.\n\u201cDarby had a chance to fall down, cross his legs, look at our kid get in front, get up and catch him,\u201d Gwynn Park football coach Danny Hayes told Capital News Service.\nDarby\u2019s speed, which carried him to Florida State University and the NFL, was the main reason he stood out at the Oxon Hill, Maryland school. He was recognized as Maryland\u2019s second-best class of 2012 football recruit and was one of the fastest high school track-and-field sprinters in the country.\n\u201cI\u2019m just naturally fast,\u201d Darby, who still carries around his USA Track & Field backpack from high school, told a small group of reporters at the Mall of America on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s in my genes.\u201d\nWhile Darby has endured injuries since then, his quickness helped him earn a starting role in each of his first three NFL seasons, now as cornerback with a team trying to win its first-ever Super Bowl. He\u2019s recorded three interceptions in nine games this season on a defense that\u2019s allowed 17 points in its two playoff games.\nThe Eagles play the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday at 6:30 p.m.\n\u201cDarby is by far the fastest guy I\u2019ve seen in a high school uniform,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cDarby\u2019s gonna do what Darby wants to do.\u201d\nDarby said he always won suicide sprints when he started playing football at eight years old, claiming his quickness came naturally. When Darby was a freshman at Potomac, football coach Ronnie Crump said Darby ran a 4.31 40-yard dash, which led colleges to contact him and Darby every week.\nCoaches from different colleges bumped into each other at Potomac. Whenever Notre Dame\u2019s coaches visited Darby, they\u2019d call him \u201cnitro\u201d to try to flatter him, Crump said.\nCrump usually develops plans for his players to try to make the NFL, but Darby was the only player Crump knew would play professionally from his freshman year.\nThe only way Hayes tried to gameplan for Darby, who played running back and cornerback, was to force him into the middle of the field.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even see Darby when he hits that corner and goes down the sideline,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf you blink, you might have an 80-yarder against you every single time.\u201d\nDuring Darby\u2019s sophomore season, Potomac played against Central High School on a muddy field after it had rained all day, so players could hardly run without slipping. The only offense that night came from Darby\u2019s three punt returns for touchdowns. Crumb said Darby accounted for about 90 percent of the Wolverines\u2019 yards in another game against Largo High School, scoring five touchdowns.\nDuring the spring, Darby dominated the track, winning the Maryland 3A state championship in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4\u00d7100 relay as a senior. He won a bronze medal in the 2011 World Youth Championships in Athletics, where the top high school track athletes around the world competed in France. Darby was one of six American men selected to represent USA Track & Field in a friendly meet in Japan in 2011.\nPotomac track-and-field coach Stan Mullins taught Darby a better sprinting technique and improved his knee lift for acceleration, which helped him in both sports.\nWhile using the leg press machine in the Potomac weight room one afternoon, Darby\u2019s hip flexors popped up over his shorts and caught the attention of his teammates and Mullins. Darby had unusually strong leg muscles, Mullins said.\n\u201cWhen you have a kid that\u2019s natural like that, the only thing you have to do is point them in the right direction,\u201d Mullins said, \u201cand keep their head straight.\u201d\nDarby hoped for a longer career by playing cornerback instead of running back in college. But he also wanted to run track for a backup option, which was one of the reasons he committed to Florida State.\nDarby looked up to former NFL cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Darrell Green, who also ran track in college. He wanted to emulate that speed. But he endured a groin injury entering Florida State, forcing him to focus on football.\nDarby still won the 2012 ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year. After nabbing two interceptions his sophomore season, he started every game the next year and won the 2013 national championship, a happiness Darby hopes to experience again Sunday.\n\u201cSuper Bowl will probably be more of a better feeling,\u201d Darby said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot harder than college.\u201d\nAfter Darby ran the seventh-fastest 40-yard dash at the 2015 NFL Combine, the Buffalo Bills drafted him with the 50th overall selection. He started all 29 games he played in and recorded a pair of interceptions over his two seasons there. In August, the Bills traded Darby to the Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round draft pick.\nDarby dislocated his ankle in the first game of the season and was carted off the field, missing eight games. Since his return, Darby\u2019s helped bolster a position group that was one of the Eagles\u2019 weaknesses in preseason.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing that it happened early on, rather than later,\u201d Darby said. \u201cI\u2019m able to play through the postseason.\u201d\nThe 5-foot-11-inch, 193-pound cornerback will often play off his receiver, making it appear as if he\u2019s not tightly guarding, then use his speed to intercept or knock down a pass. Darby will continue to lean on on that skill Sunday, when the Eagles face Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback of all time, in the Super Bowl.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got it all: Speed, quickness,\u201d Eagles safety Corey Graham said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the fastest guys I\u2019ve played with.\u201d",

Additionally, Maryland\u2019s 2016 Paralympians scored 13 gold medals, which would have placed them thirteenth among all nations competing.\nHaley Skarupa, Montgomery County\nSkarupa, 24, grew up in Rockville and started playing roller and street hockey because of her brother. When he made the switch to ice hockey, she convinced her parents to let her try it as well, and it stuck.\nAlthough she had the opportunity to attend a prep or boarding high school, Skarupa stayed in Rockville to attend Wootton High School.\n\u201cIt was a conversation I had with my parents, but we ultimately decided that if I can play with the (Washington) Pride and they\u2019re giving me just as good if not better opportunity to elevate my game, get better and stay at home, that\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d she told Capital News Service in a telephone interview.\nSkarupa said that playing for the Pride, a women\u2019s junior team based in Rockville, required plenty of travel and missed school time, \u201cand my parents sacrificed a lot to drive me and fly all over.\u201d\nThat collective dedication paid off: Skarupa played Division I hockey at Boston College, where she graduated in 2016. She owns the second-highest scoring record in college history, male or female.\nShe also succeeded on the world stage, three-peating for gold at the 2015-2017 International Ice Hockey Federation Women\u2019s World Championships.\nLeading up to the 2018 Games, Skarupa played with the Boston Pride of the National Women\u2019s Hockey League. She said skating with fellow national team players, many of whom she became close with over the years, is rewarding.\n\u201cIn a non-Olympic year, everyone\u2019s kind of separated throughout the country doing the same thing but in different spots, so I think what\u2019s different is we\u2019re able to (train) all together,\u201d she said.\nIn preparation for Pyeongchang, Team USA scrimmaged against both junior men\u2019s teams and the Canadian women\u2019s team.\nAlthough Skarupa hasn\u2019t met the other Maryland athletes, she said she\u2019d like to get to know them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some pride there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many great athletes come out of Maryland.\u201d\nThomas Hong, Howard County\nHong, 20, a lifelong Washington sports fan, was eyeing the 2018 Olympics back in 2014. He said that his life on the ice predated his own birth.\n\u201cMy mom was actually\u2026at my sisters\u2019 practice when she was pregnant with me, and she had to be rushed to the hospital during that practice,\u201d he explained in a telephone interview with CNS.\nHong was skating at age four, just after his family immigrated from South Korea to the United States. At the time, the Washington metropolitan area was a hotspot for aspiring skaters, and the region has increased in prominence since then.\nHong feels fortunate that he grew up in Howard County, and identifies strongly with his home state.\n\u201cYou can pretty much ask anybody\u2026I wear a (University of) Maryland cap every single day of my life,\u201d he said.\nHong attended the University of Maryland as a freshman during the 2015-2016 school year, but put his education on hold in pursuit of the 2018 Olympics. Following the games, he plans to return to the university for the 2018-2019 school year, according to U.S. Speedskating Communications Coordinator Austin Controulis.\nHong has spent the past months fine-tuning his approach to the upcoming races with the U.S. Speedskating coaches, with a focus on maintaining his health.\nHis performance at the Short Track World Junior Championships in January, where he won silver in the 500-meter race and bronze in the 3000-meter relay, was a big factor in his selection for Team USA.\nAlthough Hong is a Marylander at heart, he is very excited that the Olympics will be hosted by his native country.\n\u201cBeing able to go to a country where I\u2019m familiar with, being that my family is able to be there and be comfortable with as well, it just means a lot,\u201d he said.\nNoah Grove, Frederick County\nGrove, 18, was diagnosed with bone cancer and had to have his leg amputated at five years old.\nOnce he learned to run on his prosthetic leg, he played soccer and was introduced to sled hockey through the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore.\nLike Skarupa, Grove frequently traveled the country for tournaments and camps, so he seldom played in Maryland.\nWhile he expressed much love for his hometown of Frederick, Maryland, his personal feelings have taken a backseat to Team USA\u2019s overarching goal.\n\u201cTeam USA has taken over my identity as an athlete,\u201d he said in an email to CNS.\nGrove temporarily resides with his teammates at a house in Chicago, and they train together every day, which has been a new experience for him. But he said, \u201cIt\u2019s great playing against the best every day.\u201d\nHe hopes to exhibit that competitive mindset against international opponents.\nGrove played on the 2017 men\u2019s Para Ice Hockey World Championship team that won silver. The loss is fueling the team\u2019s ambitions to perform better in March.\n\u201cWe became closer and bonded over the same goal, winning a Paralympic gold medal. Since the loss, the motto of the team has become \u2018Team First,\u2019 which perfectly sums up where everyone\u2019s focus is at,\u201d Grove said.\nTwo athletes who were born in Maryland but listed home towns in other states will be in the Olympic Games as well: luger Summer Britcher, born in Baltimore, and freestyle skier Ashley Caldwell, born in Montgomery Village.\nAlso, two of the three alternate ice dancing pairs live and train in Montgomery County. Quinn Carpenter of Wheaton and Lorraine McNamara of Germantown are the second alternates, while sibling duo Michael and Rachel Parsons of Rockville are the third alternates.",

Despite experiencing some of the worst statistical years of his career, Smith now values mentoring his teammates and setting an example for them.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 When playing with wide receiver Torrey Smith for the Baltimore Ravens between 2011 and 2012, wide receiver Anquan Boldin encouraged Smith to teach his teammates everything he\u2019d learned, so his peers wouldn\u2019t commit the same mistakes.\n\nAt the time, that message wasn\u2019t that ingrained in Smith\u2019s mind. He was in the prime of his career after entering the NFL from the University of Maryland, notching at least 840 receiving yards in his first three professional seasons and helping the Ravens win the 2013 Super Bowl.\nBut as Smith\u2019s production decreased, he transitioned into a leadership role.\nSmith has set the example and served as the vocal catalyst for the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 receiver corps this season. So, after enduring the three worst statistical years of his career, he appreciates playing in the Super Bowl more than he did five years ago, and he\u2019s realized his biggest contributions may come from teaching.\n\u201cYou want to give (your teammates) everything you have, but work hard so they don\u2019t take your job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI go out there and bust my tail each and every day. I try to set the tempo. I\u2019ve had some experiences they\u2019re going to learn from, experiences that they will go through.\u201d\nThe Eagles take on the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday. The game begins at 6:30 p.m. \nSmith starred on all of his teams growing up. He was the best player in almost every game when he played quarterback for Stafford Senior High School in Falmouth, Virginia. He was so explosive that coach Chad Lewis would substitute the backup quarterback into the game during third and long situations, just so Smith could line up at wide receiver and use his speed for a first down.\nColleges recruited Smith at wide receiver because of his athleticism, and Smith was an All-ACC selection as a wide receiver and kick returner his sophomore and junior seasons at Maryland. He recorded 1,055 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns in 2010 before leaving for the NFL Draft, when the Ravens selected him in the second round.\nSmith\u2019s success continued with the Ravens, but he didn\u2019t receive the same role he had in Baltimore when the 49ers signed him in 2015. The Richmond, Virginia, native recorded a combined 930 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns in a combined 28 games in San Francisco, which won just seven games during that span.\n\u201cYou know how much goes into your heart to be ready for a game and to work the way you do and to not have that type of success? It\u2019s stressful,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI see why a lot of guys struggle with mental issues.\u201d\nWhile searching for his football identity when he joined a crowded Eagles receiving corps in March, Smith focused on Boldin\u2019s message from a few years back. While he would play behind Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor, Smith told his counterparts what tactic he\u2019s used to be successful while fostering a positive atmosphere.\nSmith notices how his teammates can improve their route-running during film sessions and practices, pulling them aside individually to provide tips.\nOff the field, Smith has also set an example for his teammates.\nHe leads the Torrey Smith Family Fund, which provides resources to children in low-income areas. He performs community service in Baltimore and Philadelphia on off-days and was one of four players who penned a letter to league Commissioner Roger Goodell to ask for league support on social activism.\nSmith has always been that outgoing, Lewis said, spending time with his most popular and shy classmates in high school.\n\u201cI can call him at two in the morning,\u201d Eagles wide receiver Mack Hollins said, \u201cand if it came down to it, he\u2019d help me out.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s advice has been especially crucial during the postseason, since he\u2019s the only Eagles wide receiver who has played in the Super Bowl.\nSmith has handed out tips on staying in the moment, telling his teammates it\u2019ll feel like a regular game once the players finish media availabilities Thursday. He\u2019s brought up the aggressive mindset of the Baltimore receivers when former Ravens wideout Jacoby Jones caught a 70-yard touchdown pass in the final minute of the 2013 AFC Divisional Round to send their game against Denver Broncos into overtime and ultimately a victory.\nThe 6-foot, 205-pound receiver also explained the butterflies and happiness that come from winning the Super Bowl, motivating his teammates to desire that same emotion.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best teammates I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Jeffery said. \u201cHe wants to see the best in you, whatever it is.\u201d\nSmith still has made crucial plays, such as the flea flicker touchdown he caught in the Eagles\u2019 38-7 win over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship. But the 29-year-old finished the regular season with his second-fewest receiving yards of his seven-year career (430).\nMuch has also changed off the field for Smith since he last played in the Super Bowl. He\u2019s had two kids, and he\u2019s traded his dreadlocks for a buzz cut.\nThe challenges he\u2019s overcome in both areas of his life left him smiling Tuesday when discussing how he\u2019ll feel as he again takes football\u2019s biggest stage.\n\u201cThis time around,\u201d Smith said, \u201cit\u2019s just way sweeter.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After wrapping up their longest stretch of road games this season, the Washington Wizards returned home Tuesday to play the Oklahoma City Thunder without point guard John Wall.\nEarlier that day, the team announced that the all-star point guard would require arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, the same knee that has bothered him all season. According to The Washington Post, Wall is expected to miss the next six to eight weeks for the Wizards.\nThis news comes at a difficult time for the team, which is currently fifth in the Eastern Conference standings. With the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers only a single loss behind the Wizards, this six-to-eight-week stretch without Wall will be critical for the team\u2019s playoff aspirations.\nOver the next six weeks, the Wizards will play 19 games \u2013 15 against teams with records above .500. Without Wall, the schedule could be a tough challenge.\nAfter all, the team will be without its second-leading scorer, assist leader and leading blocker for more than a month. As bad as this news might seem, the Wizards are still confident in the talent they have on the roster.\n\u201cYou never want to see anybody get injured, especially a guy like John,\u201d Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal said. \u201cBut things do happen and it\u2019s always next man up.\u201d\nWithout Wall, the Wizards will have to rely on backup point guard Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd as the primary ball-handler.\nDespite some struggles early in the year, the Czech guard has made the most of his increased playing time.\nDuring a nine-game stretch that Wall missed from Nov. 25 to Dec. 12 with left knee issues, Satoransk\u00fd averaged 8.4 points, 4.4 assists and 3.4 rebounds, including an impressive career-high 17-point performance against the Detroit Pistons on Dec. 1.\nThen on Tuesday night, Satoransk\u00fd put on yet another solid performance, this time as the starting point guard, in a 102-96 win against the Thunder. The Czech guard picked up six assists, five rebounds and two steals to go along with four points.\nOn the defensive side, Satoransk\u00fd also managed to limit all-star point guard Russell Westbrook to only 13 points on 5-18 shooting. When the Wizards and Thunder faced off on Jan. 25, Westbrook scored 46 points, so Satoransk\u00fd\u2019s efforts on defense made a difference the second time around.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s game, Satoransky poke about the difficulties of transitioning from being a backup player to a starter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because you\u2019re playing against their starters, so it\u2019s kind of different,\u201d Satoransk\u00fd said. \u201cIt was my fourth start in three years and obviously you got to play much more focused, on defense especially.\u201d\nWith Satoransk\u00fd making the most of his playing time, and Beal playing at an elite level, the Wizards will need small forward Otto Porter Jr. to become a more consistent scorer in Wall\u2019s absence.\nPorter is currently the team\u2019s third-leading scorer, averaging 13.8 point a game, but has struggled to find his rhythm in January, when he\u2019s only averaged 11 points.\nThe small forward has also recently dealt with hip issues and has had to miss games throughout the season because of it. Although Porter admits he is far from being fully healthy, he said he would do whatever it takes to play.\nThis should be a good sign, especially after Porter scored 25 points against the Thunder, the most he\u2019s scored since Dec. 29. The small forward hit some tough shots throughout the night and helped the Wizards pull away near the end to win.\nWith Wall out, Porter knows he and his teammates will have to rise to the occasion to keep the Wizards\u2019 playoff hopes alive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start getting W\u2019s,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to step up, including myself.\u201d",

    "summary": "Rodney McLeod, a Philadelphia Eagles safety, attributes his success in the NFL, including a trip to the Super Bowl, to the hard work and culture he experienced at DeMatha Catholic High School in Maryland. His dedication, shaped by high school traditions like reviewing game films during lunch, continued through college and into his professional career.",
    "content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Rodney McLeod, the Philadelphia Eagles starting safety, never came off the field at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, starring as a cornerback, wide receiver and kick returner.\nWhile former DeMatha coach Bill McGregor couldn\u2019t predict an NFL career for his star player, McLeod\u2019s speed and poise made him hopeful.\nOn the first play of overtime in the 2006 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference Championship game against Good Counsel, DeMatha was lined up on the 25-yard line. Instead of trying to gain short yardage, the Stags threw a fade to McLeod in the end zone on the first play. McLeod caught it, sealing one of the four league titles he won with DeMatha. The Clinton, Maryland native stills keeps a picture of that catch in his mother\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not backing away from anybody,\u201d McGregor told Capital News Service.\nMcLeod has used that explosiveness to power a six-year NFL career, now with a defense that\u2019s surrendered a combined 17 points in its two playoff games and will play for the franchise\u2019s first-ever Super Bowl win on Sunday.\n\u201cAt DeMatha, the culture is knowing hard work does pay off,\u201d McLeod told reporters at the Super Bowl Opening Night event Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s mandatory for you to be a great player. Those things helped me and keep pushing me everyday.\u201d\nMcLeod and his high school teammates spent their lunches in the film room, a tradition McLeod said shaped his work ethic. That principle stayed with him in his college career at the University of Virginia.\nMcLeod could\u2019ve been caught around the Virginia football facilities at almost any time of the day carrying a notebook between 2008 and 2011, taking notes while sitting in former coach Mike London\u2019s office or at quarterback and wide receiver meetings.\nWhile McLeod played safety, he wanted to get inside offensive players\u2019 minds, so he knew when to cut off receivers\u2019 cuts on certain routes or how many players should blitz based on the running scheme. McLeod also chose about five plays from film of every game to break down his weaknesses and notice small details in formations, a practice he continues in the NFL.\n\u201cHis football knowledge was as high as anything I\u2019ve been around,\u201d said London, who now coaches Howard University.\nIn addition to his study habits, McLeod\u2019s toughness stuck out to London.\nIn one Cavaliers home game, McLeod predicted a run play and filled the hole the back was running through. Against a bigger player, McLeod sent the crowd into a frenzy after finishing a big hit.\nThe collision bent McLeod\u2019s facemask, and his helmet hardly fit him properly with turf grass sticking out of the sides. Still, he flashed a wide grin for minutes and yelled, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019 to London as he celebrated on the sideline.\nMcLeod, though, is only 5 feet 10 inches tall, a factor in him going undrafted in 2012 and facing an uphill battle to make an NFL roster. But McLeod separated himself with his knowledge and work ethic when the St. Louis Rams signed him after the draft.\nDennard Wilson, who played at DeMatha in the late-1990s and was coaching defensive backs with St. Louis at the time, told McGregor that McLeod impressed the team with his intelligence and his defensive positioning, McGregor said. Competing against players drafted ahead of McLeod motivated him to adjust to the speed of the game, he said.\nA few weeks into practice, Wilson told McGregor he thought McLeod would sustain a 10-year NFL career.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a student of the game, and you study, that allows you to play faster, and it allows you to play more positions,\u201d said Tony Paige, McLeod\u2019s agent. \u201cThat\u2019s what coaches in the National Football League are looking for.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s prediction has panned out so far. McLeod cemented a starting role with the Rams in 2013 and signed with the Eagles as a free agent in 2016, recording three interceptions in each of the past two years, while also recovering two fumbles this season.\nOn Sunday, McLeod will be tasked with stopping Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, who have won two of the past three Super Bowls and averaged the second-most points per game during the NFL regular season.\nAs he looks to become the first DeMatha alum to win the Super Bowl, McLeod will likely spend much of his time planted in front of a screen in the film room, the same place that\u2019s propelled his career.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t help that he\u2019s 5-10,\u201d Paige said, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a 7-foot heart.\u201d\nThis story is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism.",

By 1:45 p.m., the beam was covered from end-to-end with different signatures, messages and team chants from fans wearing the team\u2019s traditional black-and-red gear.\nEven with the chilly weather, fans of all ages continued to pour into the construction site before the ceremony.\nThomas Gardiner, a University of Maryland graduate student and long-time D.C.

They also thanked the fans and season ticket holders for their continued support.\nAt the end of the ceremony, workers on the site hooked the steel beam to a large crane that had been in the background of the construction site. Simpson ordered the crane to carry the final piece of steel to the top of the stadium as fans cheered and took photos.\nWith another phase of construction at Audi Field completed, Simpson said that there would be no delays and that D.C.

At two home games \u2014 a loss to Dallas on Oct. 29 and a loss to Minnesota on Nov. 12 \u2014 CNS took detailed photographs of each section and analyzed them with a computer program that made it easier to count visiting team fans in the images.     \nIntense rain at the Cowboys game made it difficult to get an accurate count of the visiting fan presence for the entire stadium. But CNS determined that there were at least 3,345 Vikings fans in the crowd on Nov. 12 \u2014  about 5 percent of the announced attendance of 74,476 on that clear day. \n[https://twitter.com/SageRosenfels18/status/929799997759152129]\nIt\u2019s possible there were more Vikings fans in the crowd than CNS counted. Our count was conservative, only marking someone as a fan if they were clearly wearing Vikings apparel.  \n\nAgainst the Cowboys, Washington\u2019s biggest rival, the presence of visiting team fans was also striking. In Section 119, in the lower bowl on the 20-yard line, CNS counted 135 Cowboys fans to 111 Washington fans, while another 249 could not be determined based on their clothing. In sections 106 and 107, CNS found 84 Cowboys fans, 111 Washington fans and 311 who could not be determined based on their clothing. \n\u201cWe own this place,\u201d Cowboys fan Chip Garland bragged. \u201cPut that in the paper.\u201d\nWashington posted its second-highest home attendance mark of the season that day, with 78,428 fans, just a few hundred fewer than their season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles (78,685). The Cowboys went on to win, 33-19, and the majority of fans stayed through a second half affected by steady rain.\n\nFather and son Brad and Braedon MacArthur traveled from their hometown just north of Toronto to FedEx Field to attend their first Cowboys game. \nTheir Lyft driver told them on the way to the stadium that Maryland is \u201c50/50\u201d in terms of Washington and Dallas fans, they said. An hour and a half before the game, they had already met Cowboy fans from Austin, Texas and Virginia.\nWashington fan Mike Greene, a native Marylander, was also at the Cowboys game. He said he has seen the effect of visiting fans even at non-division rivalry games. He once sold some of his season tickets to an acquaintance whose fan affiliation he wasn\u2019t aware of.\n\u201cI\u2019m a sales guy and one of my customers knew that we had season tickets. So she wanted my tickets and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a good way to build a bridge,\u201d Greene said. \u201cCome to find out she\u2019s a Pittsburgh fan and she wasn\u2019t even there \u2013 she gave all [the tickets] to her Pittsburgh fan friends. We got here and it was a significant number of Pittsburgh people here, and that did affect the home-field advantage. They were pretty loud.\u201d\nGreene agrees that Dallas has fans all around the country, \u201cbut they\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d He said he has gone to Dallas for games three times and earlier this year attended Washington\u2019s Monday night game at Kansas City. \n\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed\u201d how many Washington fans also travel, he said. \u201cWe met people there from Idaho that were (Washington) fans.\u201d\nRolando Montana is a Cowboys fan originally from Texas, now living in Arlington, Virginia. He\u2019s been attending Dallas-Washington games since the days of RFK Stadium. But Montana didn\u2019t believe it hurt Washington\u2019s home-field advantage and said he\u2019s experienced the inverse\u2013he sat next to Washington fans the last time he went to a game in Dallas.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got them in both places,\u201d he said.\nOne other thing: His son was tossing a football around with a young fan wearing Washington red.\n\u201cGoes to show how easy people can get along,\u201d Montana said.\n-30-",

    "summary": "The Capitals' top line of Ovechkin, Backstrom, and Wilson dominated with three goals in four minutes, leading Washington to a 6-2 victory over the Blackhawks. This performance marked a continuation of the team's offensive resurgence, with Backstrom ending his goal drought and Wilson achieving his first four-point game.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Capitals\u2019 top line accounted for three goals in a four-minute span late in the first period Wednesday, propelling Washington to a 6-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks at Capital One Arena.\nAlex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Tom Wilson each scored and tallied at least one assist during the sequence, a continuation of the Capitals\u2019 recent offensive resurgence. Washington has now won six of their last seven games, and have scored at least four goals in five of them.\n\u201cThat line carried us tonight,\u201d head coach Barry Trotz said.\nBackstrom struck first, ending a 21-game goal drought with a shot from between the face-off circles, set up by a swift tap pass from Ovechkin, who positioned himself to the left of Blackhawks goalie Anton Forsberg.\nThree minutes later, Tom Wilson unleashed a shot from the left side boards that caught the fourth-year goaltender by surprise, allowing the puck to slide under Forsberg\u2019s right leg pad.\nOn the ensuing shift, defenseman Dmitry Orlov sprung Wilson on a breakaway with a well-timed dump pass. Wilson was turned away by Forsberg, but Ovechkin was there to follow up the shot and rifle it into an empty net.\nThe Ovechkin-Backstrom-Wilson trio finished with a combined 11 points Wednesday, led by Wilson\u2019s first career four-point-game.\nSince Barry Trotz reunited Ovechkin with Backstrom, his longtime center, November 22 against Ottawa, the Capitals\u2019 captain has scored eight goals in seven games. But the combination has also benefitted the continued development of Tom Wilson, who was more than just a passenger on the team\u2019s most potent line.\n\u201cTom adds an element,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cHe gets pucks, he keeps plays alive, he makes people move the puck a little quicker. I think it\u2019s energized that line a little bit. So, he\u2019s done a really good job and he\u2019s getting rewarded for some really good work.\u201d\nWilson, more known for his physicality than his offensive skillset, has had to pick up the pace of his play to be able to flank world-class players in Ovechkin and Backstrom.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both working real hard for me, which helps,\u201d Wilson said. \u201c[Ovechkin] is playing with a lot of energy, [Backstrom] is so easy to play with. I\u2019ve found that poise with the puck and they seem to be open and it\u2019s just about making the play.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge for him, huge for us,\u201d Ovechkin said, referencing Wilson. \u201cI think he has to realize how he [has] to play, especially with a center like [Backstrom].\u201d\nWilson, a first-round pick in 2012, had nine points in 24 games entering Wednesday, and has yet to eclipse 25 points in a 82-game season during his career. The coaching staff has said in the past they wanted more offensive production from Wilson, and he has shown marked improvement playing alongside Ovechkin and Backstrom.\n\u201cHe accepts those challenges that we put in front of him and he keeps growing, so I think he\u2019s one a real good path for some success,\u201d Trotz said.\nThe Capitals also received goals from Brett Connolly and Evgeny Kuznetsov, with Ovechkin registering the assists on both. With the win, Washington moved into third place in the Metropolitan Division, leaping the idle New York Islanders.\nThe Capitals third-straight win was punctuated by Wilson\u2019s empty-net goal, which came without his top-tier linemates on the ice.\n\u201cHe\u2019s making plays,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the puck a lot more, he\u2019s touching it and you can see that his confidence in that area is growing.\u201d",

    "summary": "Alex Ovechkin's recent hat trick brought his career total to 20, making him the leader among active players but still far behind all-time leaders like Wayne Gretzky. The era in which Ovechkin plays, characterized by better defensive strategies and goaltending, makes it unlikely he will surpass the records set in higher-scoring times.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 With his third hat trick of the season Saturday, Alex Ovechkin is quickly climbing the list of all-time hat trick leaders. But the NHL\u2019s premier goal scorer of the 21st century is unlikely to ever top that list because of the era he plays in.\nWith seven goals in the Capitals\u2019 first two games and Saturday\u2019s three-goal performance against Toronto, Ovechkin brought his career regular season hat trick total to 20, the most among active players. The next closest active skater, future Hall of Fame forward Jaromir Jagr, has 15 but has played in 779 more NHL games than the 32-year-old Russian.\n\u201cSometimes you are just feeling it,\u201d Ovechkin told the Associated Press after Saturday\u2019s victory.\nPractically peerless when it comes to three-goal games among current players, Ovechkin still remains well behind the league\u2019s all-time leaders. Wayne Gretzky sits atop the list with 50 regular season hat tricks, with Mario Lemieux (40), Mike Bossy (39), Brett Hull (33) and Phil Esposito (32) rounding out the top five. Ovechkin is in a three-way tie for 14th.\n\u201cTypically, the amount of hat tricks a player has is going to fairly closely track how dominant of a goal scorer they were,\u201d hockey historian James Benesh said. \u201cThe ones who were consistently the best goal scorers of their time are going to be the ones who rack up the most goals and sometimes three of them are going to come in one game.\u201d\n\n\nUnlike Gretzky, Ovechkin has played his entire career in an era where scoring goals is much less common. As a result of larger goaltender equipment, refined defensive strategies and improved physical conditioning, players in today\u2019s NHL have to work harder to find the back of the net.\nGretzky, widely considered the greatest player ever, played his prime years in the high-flying 1980s, where the style of play favored high-powered offenses. During the decade, smaller players took up less space and less athletic goaltenders wearing smaller pads offered skaters more net to shoot at. And more relaxed coaching strategies resulted in more goal scoring.\nDuring Gretzky\u2019s first 12 NHL seasons (1979-1980 to 1990-1991) the average number of goals scored in a game fluctuated between 6.92 and at 8.02, according to Hockey Reference.\nThe goals per game rate began took a significant dip in the latter half of Gretzky\u2019s career. It dropped exactly two goals per game between 1993 and his final season in 1999, signaling the start of the NHL\u2019s Dead Puck Era. By the 2003-2004 season, the goals per game rate registered a 42-year low at 5.14.\nAt the beginning of Ovechkin\u2019s rookie season in 2005-2006, the league enacted rule changes to increase league-wide scoring. It eliminated the two-line pass rule, which prevented players from receiving passes from their own defensive zone past center ice. It introduced the trapezoid behind the net to restrict goalies\u2019 puck-handling capabilities. And it strictly enforced holding infractions.\nAs a result, the goals per game average rose to 6.16 in 2005-2006. The changes failed to have a permanent effect on scoring rates. The average goals per game rate has failed to exceed 6.0 since, fluctuating between 5.42 and 5.90.\n\n\n\u201cYou could say one goal today is like one-third of a win,\u201d Benesh said. \u201cSometimes in the [1980s] a goal was one-fifth of a win. So, it\u2019s definitely different. It made it a lot easier to score goals, it made it a lot easier to get more hat tricks in a higher scoring environment too.\u201d\nOvechkin has led the NHL in hat tricks just once, racking up two during the 38-game lockout-shortened 2013 season. But he has scored multiple hat tricks in six seasons, including this year.\nTwenty-five games into the 2017-2018 season, Ovechkin has three, already matching last year\u2019s season high set by Patrik Laine of the Winnipeg Jets. With three goals against the Maple Leafs on Saturday, he passed Peter Bondra to become the Capitals franchise hat trick leader.\nDespite Ovechkin\u2019s impressive start, he still remains well behind Gretzky, who reached 20 hat tricks at the age of 22, putting Ovechkin far behind the Great One\u2019s scorching pace.\n\n\nWhile Ovechkin will probably not surpass Gretzky\u2019s career hat trick record, the data suggests that Ovechkin has been hampered by lower scoring rates during his career. The Capitals winger has fallen one goal short of a hat trick 95 times in 13 seasons, with opportunities likely waning as he ages.\nNo matter where Ovechkin finishes on the all-time career hat trick list, he should still be viewed as his generation\u2019s best finisher, and most prolific hat trick scorer.",

    "summary": "Joe Flacco's 2017 season is his worst yet, with poor deep passing and more interceptions than touchdowns, placing him among the league's least effective quarterbacks. Despite leading in completion percentage, Flacco's struggles have contributed significantly to the Baltimore Ravens' inconsistent performance this season.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Coming off a win over Green Bay Sunday, the Baltimore Ravens sit at 5-5, currently holding a playoff spot in the AFC despite wildly inconsistent quarterback play from Joe Flacco.\nFlacco is having the worst season of his career, ranking as one of the league\u2019s worst passers in 2017, a Capital News Service analysis found. This can be attributed, in part, to his reluctance to throw passes deep down field, an early-career trademark that helped him win a Super Bowl in 2012.\nThe ten-year NFL veteran is averaging just 173 yards per game, tied for second lowest in the league with Cleveland Browns rookie DeShone Kizer. He\u2019s ahead of only Green Bay Packers rookie Brett Hundley.\nFlacco is just one of five quarterbacks to throw more interceptions than touchdowns this year, joining Kizer, Hundley, San Francisco 49ers rookie C.J. Beathard, and the recently-demoted-to-backup Trevor Siemian of the Denver Broncos.\nHe has thrown a touchdown on just 2.8 percent of his pass attempts, the lowest mark of his career. Meanwhile, he has thrown an interception on 3.4 percent of his attempts, which is just a tick below the career-worst 3.6 percent he set in 2013.\nFlacco\u2019s worst season was 2013, when he set career lows in total quarterback rating (51.2), TD-interception ratio (0.86), and yards per pass attempt (6.4). Through ten games this season, he is on track for lower marks in each of those categories.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been a little bit quick to get the ball out of my hands at times,\u201d Flacco said in a Baltimore Sun article in October. \u201cI think if I just hang in there and trust the process, trust the pocket, and I might have to step up and make some plays here and there.\u201d\nDespite Flacco\u2019s many struggles this season, he still ranks in the top third of the NFL in completion percentage. In fact, his 65.5 percent to date is the best single-season mark he has posted, better than the career high 64.9 mark he set a year ago. But while he is completing passes, he has failed to make big plays.\nFor much of his career, Flacco\u2019s signature talent has been his ability to launch the deep ball down field, like the 70-yard pass to Jacoby Jones in the 2012 Divisional Round against Denver. This year, he has shied away from taking deep shots.\nAccording to NFL.com, Flacco\u2019s pass attempts go 6.8 yards down the field, last of all qualified quarterbacks. (That stat doesn\u2019t take into account a receiver running with the ball after the catch). His pass attempts, on average, land 2.1 yards short of a first down, the worst in the NFL. (Capital News Service only looked at the 33 quarterbacks with at least 150 passing attempts this season.)\nWith completed passes, Flacco is averaging just 5.44 yards per pass attempt this season, the worst mark of his career and the worst for any passer since Blaine Gabbert\u2019s 5.36 yards per attempt in 2011.\nFlacco has hesitated to throw deep in recent years. His percentage of pass attempts that are for more than 20 yards has decreased every year since hitting a high in 2012, and sits at a career low 6.9 percent this season.\nWhen he does throw the deep ball, he isn\u2019t successful; on these attempts in 2017, he is 5-for-22 (22.7 percent), with two touchdowns and three interceptions, per ESPN.\n\nPerhaps in the past, Flacco\u2019s success was driven by the weapons around him. When he won the Super Bowl in 2012, the Ravens\u2019 offense featured Ray Rice, Torrey Smith and Anquan Boldin. But while their offense today is not as stacked, it still features Jeremy Maclin and Mike Wallace, Pro Bowl receivers who each have multiple 1,000 yard seasons to their name, and Alex Collins, who has been a pleasant surprise out of the backfield.\nFlacco won a Super Bowl and subsequently earned a big payday on the strength of his deep throws down field. Now, he struggles to make those throws, and has morphed into one of the least effective quarterbacks in the NFL.\nFiveThirtyEight gives the Ravens a 65 percent chance of making the playoffs, a number that dramatically increased after Sunday\u2019s victory. But with a crowded AFC playoff hunt, they will need better quarterback play from Flacco to be a legitimate contender.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Maryland\u2019s two NFL stadiums could be the sites of FIFA World Cup matches come 2026, and executives in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore are working to make that happen.\nWashington and Baltimore are two of 32 cities vying to be named official host cities for a joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The United Bid Committee, a partnered effort by the United States, Mexico and Canada to win hosting rights for the men\u2019s tournament, is competing with Morocco to host that Cup, and FIFA will announce its choice next June.\nRepresentatives from the 32 cities in contention met in Houston last week for a three-day workshop to present their bids to the United Bid Committee. If North America wins, the committee would pick its official host cities by 2021, said Terry Hasseltine, the chair of Baltimore\u2019s host committee.\nM&T Bank Stadium, the home of the Baltimore Ravens, would host matches if Baltimore is chosen. Baltimore\u2019s bid is a joint effort by the Maryland Stadium Authority, Maryland Sports (the state\u2019s sports commission), Visit Baltimore and several other government entities. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford serves as the bid\u2019s honorary chair.\nThe Washington bid\u2019s proposed venue is FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, the home of the Washington NFL team. Two organizations are leading the charge: Events DC, which manages venues and convention centers in and around the District, and Destination DC, which handles marketing the city.\n\u201cClearly the impact of soccer, or \u2018the real football\u2019 as it\u2019s called outside the U.S., is big and this affords us the chance to play a larger role for an international audience,\u201d said Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC.\nPerhaps the main draw for cities to partake in a World Cup is the revenue matches are expected to inject into local economies. The 2014 World Cup was estimated to add $3 billion in economic impact for host country Brazil, Forbes reported.\n\u201cAt the end of the day our organization is an economic development organization,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe economic impact for the city is significant.\u201d\nThe cachet of a global event like the World Cup is also attractive, said Lawrence Hamm, Destination DC\u2019s sports development manager who represented Washington in last week\u2019s workshop.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for us\u2026 It\u2019s the reputation of the World Cup that\u2019s on the line, and the reputation of North America,\u201d Hamm said.\nAll cities at the current stage have shown the United Bid Committee they have the infrastructure to host and transport tens of thousands of fans. At the Houston workshop, the United Bid Committee held sessions to discuss how to incorporate innovation, sustainability and human rights initiatives in the bid, Hasseltine said.\n\nThe next step for Baltimore\u2019s bid is for Hasseltine to meet with his partners and community leaders \u201cto get people to understand the weight and the magnitude of what was presented to us so we can meet those deadlines,\u201d he said.\nA less quantifiable factor the committee will consider is the soccer community of each city. Washington has a Major League Soccer franchise, D.C. United, and a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team, the Washington Spirit. The city hosted matches when the United States held the 1994 World Cup, at RFK Stadium, and the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup, at FedEx Field. The Washington Post reported that the city was the top-rated U.S. market for television viewership through all 64 matches of the 2014 World Cup. \nOn the Baltimore side, Hasseltine also cited TV viewership for international matches when explaining Baltimore\u2019s soccer community, despite the city\u2019s lack of a pro team.\n\u201c(It) means that we have a very large community, and maybe it might be a little bit of a sleeping soccer community,\u201d said Hasseltine, the executive director for Maryland Sports and vice president of communications for the Maryland Stadium Authority.\nHasseltine and Ferguson said they do not see Baltimore and Washington as being in direct competition with one another. Their proximity is an asset, Hasseltine said, because a set of group stage matches among four teams could be played in one geographic area.\n\u201cWhen you look at pool play, which is something we would probably fall most in line with, it is a great venue setup for them to put a pool here in the Mid-Atlantic,\u201d Hasseltine said. \u201cNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and potentially D.C. Just imagine the transportation ease when you\u2019ve got Amtrak and easy flights and I-95.\u201d\nThat proximity could provide teams with ease of travel between matches \u2014 and fans as well. Many American fans have multiple rooting interests because Washington is a \u201ctransplant city,\u201d said Melissa Wiley, the secretary of the Washington chapter of American Outlaws, a supporters\u2019 group of the U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s national soccer teams with chapters nationwide.\nWiley knows several local soccer fans who support both the U.S. team and another national team aligned with their background.\n\u201cI think you find a lot of that in D.C. because you have people who are first generation of growing up in the United States, and so they support the U.S. but they also support the team that their parents support,\u201d Wiley said.\nIf Washington hosts World Cup matches in the future, it would inspire the area\u2019s youngest generation of soccer players and fans, she added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different atmosphere,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI went to Brazil in 2014 and the atmosphere of those games is so much different, so much more electric than just a regular game.\u201d",

    "summary": "Shohei Ohtani, a Japanese baseball phenom, has the potential to become the best two-way player since Babe Ruth if he successfully transitions to MLB, though he may face an adjustment period like other Japanese stars. His usage in MLB could vary depending on the league and team, with possibilities including serving as a designated hitter, pinch hitter, or outfielder on non-pitching days.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 If Shohei Ohtani can successfully make the transition to Major League Baseball, he has the chance to become the best two-way player since Babe Ruth.\nBut if Ohtani \u2014 a Japanese pitching and hitting phenom \u2014 is anything like other stars who jumped from Japan, he will face an adjustment period in the U.S.\nOver the last two decades, Japanese standouts have consistently struggled to match their production in Nippon Professional Baseball, the top league in Japan. In almost every case, pitchers gave up more runs and hitters were less effective at the plate.\nHideki Matsui (the New York Yankees and other teams) and Ichiro Suzuki (the Seattle Mariners and other teams) \u2014 the two most successful Japanese baseball players in the past 30 years \u2014 saw a decline in production, even though they still put up good numbers. Matsui\u2019s OPS (On base percentage plus Slugging) declined 22.94 percent in his first three MLB seasons, while Ichiro\u2019s decreased by 16.33 percent.\n\nTwo successful Japanese pitchers, Yu Darvish (the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers) and Masahiro Tanaka (the Yankees), also saw a drop in production. The two allowed 1.65 and 1.61 more runs during their first three seasons in the U.S., respectively, than they did in Japan, while giving up 0.9 and 0.6 more home runs per nine innings.\n\nOhtani is a very unique player, excelling in both hitting and pitching for the Nippon Ham Fighters, where he both pitches and serves as designated hitter. It\u2019s not clear how a MLB team will use him, but it might depend on which league he ends up in.\nAn American League team might use him as its designated hitter on days he doesn\u2019t pitch. A National League team could use him as a pinch hitter when he isn\u2019t pitching. In either league, he could also play outfield on non-pitching days, something he did in 62 games in Japan prior to 2015.\nWhat could Ohtani\u2019s performance on the mound and at the plate look like in the U.S.? To develop a rough estimate, Capital News Service adjusted Ohtani\u2019s pitching and hitting stats in Japan to account for the performance drop-off Japanese players experience when entering MLB.\nOur best guess: Ohtani will not be as good in the U.S. as he is in Japan. But he\u2019ll still probably be one of the better Japanese pitchers in MLB, with a batting average slightly below the typical Japanese hitter in the U.S. And he\u2019ll probably be the best hitting pitcher in all of baseball.\nHere\u2019s how we did it. First, we looked at every Japanese player who played at least two years in the Japanese pro league and at least two years in MLB. For several hitting and pitching statistics, we took the average for each player\u2019s final seasons in Japan and the average of their first few seasons in the U.S. We then calculated the difference, and used that to adjust Ohtani\u2019s Japanese statistics to predict his American performance.\nThere are several limitations to this method. The sample size here is small, with 11 hitters and 21 pitchers. And we didn\u2019t control for factors like age. At 23, Ohtani would be one of the youngest Japanese players to make the jump.\nAt the plate, we project Ohtani\u2019s OPS (on base percentage plus slugging percentage) at .708, slightly lower than average for Japanese players in the U.S.. We think he\u2019ll hit around 15 home runs, if he has a full season of at bats.\n\nAs a pitcher, Ohtani would sport a 3.14 ERA while giving up an average of 0.72 home runs per nine innings, better than average for Japanese players in the U.S.\n\nBy Japanese league standards, Ohtani is great pitcher and a great hitter. By the standard of Japanese hitters who jump to the U.S., Ohtani\u2019s OPS in his last three seasons in Japan is below the average of .895.\nIn the U.S., we think Ohtani will likely be the best hitting pitcher by a good margin, surpassing Madison Bumgarner (San Francisco Giants) for that honor. Bumgarner, who is considered by many to be the league\u2019s best hitting pitcher, has a .631 OPS over the past five seasons, while we project Otani\u2019s OPS would be .077 points higher.\n\nWe also think he\u2019ll be one of the better pitchers in the U.S., with a projected ERA of 3.14 \u2014 much better than the league average of 4.31 for all pitchers.\nOhtani is expected to make the jump in 2018. His NPB team, the Nippon Ham Fighters, announced Friday it would make him eligible to move to the U.S. And Ohtani seems eager to play in the U.S. now, instead of waiting until he\u2019s 25, a move that could cost him tens of millions of dollars.\nRegardless of when Ohtani comes to America, he is set to shake up MLB norms as an impact player on the mound and at the plate.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Sacramento Kings had trimmed a 21-point Wizards lead to 14 with 5:55 to play in their Monday contest.\nWizards coach Scott Brooks had seen enough from his second unit.\nA minute later, John Wall had Kings rookie De\u2019Aaron Fox on his hip in the high post. He spun, and Fox was left in his wake. Wall\u2019s layup gave the Wizards a 99-83 lead and spurred an 8-0 run.\nThe game\u2019s outcome was never in doubt again, as Washington downed Sacramento, 110-82.\nWall outclassed Fox on the spin, exposing his defender\u2019s youth and quashing any hopes of a comeback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so much bigger than me, I was just making sure he didn\u2019t overpower me and back me all the way down,\u201d Fox explained later. \u201cHe felt me leaning to one side and he did the spin move.\u201d\nFox, who came off the bench Monday, was in the starting lineup when the Wizards and Kings squared off in Sacramento Oct. 29. He totaled 26 minutes in both contests, but failed to shoot greater than 30 percent from the field in either game.\nStill, Fox insisted, the early-season matchups against Wall have been beneficial to his development. He called Wall \u201ca mentor\u201d and said he talks to Wall more than any other player in the league, save for his teammates on the Kings and former players at his alma mater, the University of Kentucky.\nFox said Wall has urged him to \u201cstay working, stay humble.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get down when you\u2019re losing,\u201d Fox said Wall told him. \u201cThis is something top picks go through all the time.\u201d\nWall has been in Fox\u2019s position before. Both guards are lightning-quick Kentucky products who are devastating in the open court. Both came into the league on struggling teams.\nIn Wall\u2019s first three years in the NBA, the Wizards failed to win 30 games in a single season. After Fox\u2019s first 13 professional games, the Kings sit at an underwhelming 3-10.\nBrooks also saw his fair share of losing in his first few years coaching the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nBrooks began the 2008-09 season as an assistant to P.J. Carlesimo. After a 1-12 start to the year though, Brooks assumed coaching duties. Despite the coaching change, the losing continued. The Thunder would lose 17 of their next 19 games, and finish the year at 23-59, despite boasting a feisty, rookie point guard you may have heard of: Russell Westbrook.\nBrooks offered Fox some advice.\n\u201cThe only way you get better in this league is by giving great effort every day,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way, there\u2019s no vitamins you can take to be a better player. You gotta do it with the hard work and grind.\u201d\nAlthough Fox may not have the same ferocity around the rim that Wall and Westbrook have shown from the onset of their careers, he certainly has their speed. And unfortunately for him, the same lack of winning that they suffered through, too.\nGiven the Kings\u2019 extremely young core \u2013 eight of their featured players have less than two years of experience in the league \u2013 the jury is still out on how they will fare in coming years.\nAnd although the Kings won\u2019t play the Wizards again until next year, Fox anticipates the next matchup against fellow Kentucky alumnus Wall.\n\u201c(I\u2019ll have) a year of experience, a year of getting my body right, getting my body even more NBA-ready,\u201d Fox said. \u201cJust being able to say: \u2018I\u2019ve played against him before, I know what he\u2019s going to do,\u2019 but you still have to go out there and play.\u201d\nRegardless of how the Kings fare this year, studying from Wall will certainly serve Fox well and he acknowledged as much.\n\u201c(Wall) just talks about going through it and being able to power through it from a point guard\u2019s perspective,\u201d Fox said. \u201cNow (the Wizards) are one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference.\u201d",

That concerted effort has helped other areas of his game too, he contends.\n\u201cIt kinda helps me get in better shape and not get tired as quick,\u201d Wall said.\nOn a night like Saturday, when Wall was \u201cvery sick\u201d and wore a ski mask upon entering the arena, that conditioning proved particularly helpful. Wall, who didn\u2019t get to warm up because he received two IVs, admitted he didn\u2019t have the same energy or burst he normally does.\n\u201cMy migraines came back and I had a cold on top of that,\u201d Wall explained.\nNonetheless, Wall was proud of his play Saturday night.\n\u201cI thought I played OK,\u201d said Wall, who has drawn a poor shooting night from the opposition\u2019s point guard in Washington\u2019s last two games, after holding Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball to a 3-12 clip Thursday.\nDefense has been a point of concentration all year for the Wizards, who have conceded over 110 points to the sub-.500 Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns, and a 130-point scoring barrage to the Cleveland Cavaliers. All of those disappointing performances were at home.\nBut Wall had an optimistic outlook, given the improved defense the Wizards have shown from the latter part of this home stand.\n\u201cIf we can just stick to the basics of our concepts,\u201d Wall said, \u201cI like our chances against anybody.\u201d\nSick or not, the point guard will certainly play a large role in how well that defense fares going forward.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 John Carlson registered his second two-point game in three contests in the Capitals\u2019 4-1 win against Pittsburgh at Capital One Arena Friday.\nThe 27-year-old defenseman quarterbacked an efficient Washington power play that scored twice, first on a Carlson slap shot in the first period and late in the second on a T.J. Oshie redirect of a Carlson point shot.\nOshie\u2019s goal gave the Capitals a lead that would last, as Washington kept Pittsburgh off the scoresheet for the game\u2019s final 31 minutes.\nThrough the Capitals\u2019 first 17 games, the 27-year-old defenseman is third in average ice time in the NHL, playing just over 27 minutes per night. Friday\u2019s contest marked the fourth time this season Carlson has played at least 28 minutes in a game.\nWith Matt Niskanen missing his twelfth consecutive game with an upper body injury, Carlson has been relied on to play lengthy and often difficult minutes for a depleted Capitals\u2019 defensive corps. The task was made no easier by Washington\u2019s opponent Friday, who boast some of the league\u2019s premier offensive talent.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever get used to it, I think you just try to manage it, you try to make sure that you\u2019re bringing the energy and enthusiasm,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to make little mistakes sometimes, obviously, when you\u2019re playing that much. Sometimes easier things get harder and mentally you just have to be prepared and accept the challenge and go after it. I don\u2019t think you can float your way through games.\u201d\nCarlson has also shouldered a heavier offensive burden for the team and now has 13 points on the season, tenth-best among defenseman.\n\u201cI think he plays well, plays better when he\u2019s playing more, one of those players,\u201d said goalie Braden Holtby, who recorded his 200th career win Friday. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a surprise to any of us that he\u2019s playing the way he is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to need [from] him the rest of the year and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to bring because he\u2019s that type of player.\u201d\nOshie scored his second-period goal with one second remaining on a four-minute power play, a rare opportunity afforded to Washington after Kris Letang was called for two separate minor penalties on the same sequence.\n\u201cIt was one of those things where you get one of those long, lengthy power plays and you come out empty, the other team maybe gets a little momentum,\u201d Barry Trotz said. \u201cWe scored right at the end and any momentum that they may have had sort of dissipated real quickly.\u201d\nThe Capitals carried a 2-1 advantage into the second intermission and killed off two consecutive Penguins\u2019 power plays early in the third that helped tilt momentum even further in Washington\u2019s favor.\nThird period goals from rookies Chandler Stephenson and Jakub Vrana cemented the victory, the team\u2019s fourth win in their past five games.\n\u201cI think we just [have] to see what we\u2019re doing positively, see the things we\u2019re doing real well,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe talked about them in the beginning of the year, we just didn\u2019t execute them.

    "summary": "Jay Gruden relied heavily on his pre-existing relationships from his time working with his brother Jon Gruden to build his coaching staff for Washington\u2019s NFL franchise, demonstrating the importance of networking in the NFL. Despite this, he did not bring anyone from his more recent stint with Marvin Lewis' Bengals staff to Washington.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 When Jay Gruden was named head coach of Washington\u2019s NFL franchise in 2014, he set out to construct a winning coaching staff.\nTo do that, he drew on pre-existing relationships in the \u201ccoaching social network\u201d he established during his decade as an assistant coach under his brother Jon Gruden in Tampa Bay and Marvin Lewis in Cincinnati, a Capital News Service social network analysis found.\nIn the NFL, who you know often matters as much as what you know, with coaches demonstrating a strong preference for familiar people. It\u2019s not unusual for one coach to work with another coach on multiple teams, creating a complex web of connections that spans generations.\nFor Jay Gruden, some parts of his coaching web have proved more important in filling open jobs in Washington. To build his staff \u2014 and replace assistants who departed for bigger jobs elsewhere \u2014 he has drawn more heavily on the network he established working for his brother\u2019s Buccaneers between 2002 and 2008 than the network he built as an assistant with the Bengals under Lewis between 2011 and 2013, the analysis found. In fact, he hasn\u2019t brought anyone from Lewis\u2019 Bengals staff to Washington.\nTo do the analysis, Capital News Service built a dataset that included every coach and assistant who has ever worked in the NFL with Jon Gruden and Lewis. We then selected everyone from that list who later became an NFL head coach \u2014 13 people, including Jay Gruden, Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan \u2014 and added all of their NFL colleagues to the dataset.\nHere are five other interesting things we found looking into the web of connections around Jon Gruden and Lewis.\n1. Jon Gruden and Lewis have had a lasting impact on the league as mentors.\nSuccessful coaches create opportunities for their top assistants to land head coaching gigs elsewhere.\nNine people who worked for Jon Gruden during his four years as head coach in Oakland and Tampa Bay later became head coaches. This includes Shanahan (San Francisco 49ers), Raheem Morris (formerly Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Sean McVay (Los Angeles Rams), Marc Trestman (formerly Chicago Bears), Bill Callahan (formerly Oakland Raiders), Gus Bradley (formerly Jacksonville Jaguars), Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Rod Marinelli (formerly Detroit Lions).\nThe visualization below shows the network of relationships between Jon Gruden, those nine people \u2014 and every assistant coach any of them worked with. The dense, interconnected nature of this network is striking, showing a surprising number of assistant coaches who worked with each other on different teams.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen a social network visualization before, here\u2019s how to interpret it (and subsequent visualizations in this story).\n\nEach dot is a person. Bigger dots are more important parts of the network, as measured by a statistic called \u201ccentrality.\u201d Head coaches are the biggest, with lots of common connections. Medium sized circles are the most important assistants, people who show up repeatedly on the staffs of several head coaches. The smaller dots are less important people.\nEach line is a connection between two people. People who have worked together for many years have a stronger tie and, thus, a thicker line.\nThe colors identify \u201ccommunities\u201d in the network, clusters of people with lots of overlapping connections between them, and fewer connections to other parts of the network. Jay Gruden and McVay (offensive coordinator under Jay Gruden in Washington) have a lot of overlapping connections, which puts them in the same red-colored community.\n\nFive people who worked for Lewis have gone onto head coaching gigs in the NFL: Jay Gruden, Mike Zimmer (Minnesota Vikings), Hue Jackson (Cleveland Browns), Vance Joseph (Denver Broncos) and Leslie Frazier (formerly of the Minnesota Vikings).\n\n2. Latching onto a veteran coach can help inexperienced assistants move up the ranks.\nThe progression of McVay from an assistant coach to offensive coordinator to head coach illustrates how a coach\u2019s network influences his NFL career.\nJay Gruden and McVay first worked together in Tampa Bay in 2008, as coaching assistants. In 2009, after the Buccaneers fired Jon Gruden, Jay Gruden and McVay worked for the United Football League\u2019s Florida Tuskers as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach, respectively.\nIn 2010, McVay joined Washington\u2019s coaching staff when Mike Shanahan became head coach. He worked under offensive coordinator Shanahan, who also spent time under Jon Gruden\u2019s Buccaneers, but left before McVay arrived. When Jay Gruden took over for Mike Shanahan in 2014, he promoted McVay from tight ends coach to offensive coordinator.\nIn Washington in 2010, McVay first worked with then-quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur. He became McVay\u2019s offensive coordinator in Los Angeles when McVay took the reins this year. LaFleur worked with three different head coaches in the network we examined in three different cities \u2014 McVay (Washington, L.A.), Shanahan (Washington, Atlanta) and Morris (Washington, Atlanta).\n\n3. Relationships help fired coaches get back on their feet.\nJoe Barry, who has held NFL defensive coaching positions for most of the last two decades, has deep ties to the head coaches that make up the extended Jon Gruden network. These connections helped Barry get back to the league after the Detroit Lions fired him as defensive coordinator after the team\u2019s winless 2008 season.\nIn 2009, he returned to Tampa Bay as linebackers coach under new head coach Raheem Morris. They had both worked together in Tampa Bay from 2002-2005 under Jon Gruden. Barry was one of the most important pieces of the network we examined, with ties to eight head coaches. He served as Jay Gruden\u2019s defensive coordinator in Washington for two years before being fired.\n\nGreg Olson also used the Jon Gruden coaching network to get a new job after being fired from Oakland as offensive coordinator in 2014. He caught on with the Jacksonville Jaguars as offensive coordinator in 2015 under head coach Gus Bradley, who he worked with in Tampa Bay in 2008. Bradley and Olson were both fired in 2016. This year, Olson signed on with an old Tampa Bay colleague \u2014 McVay \u2014 as quarterbacks coach in Los Angeles.\n\n4. One way to acquire lots of connections is to stay in one spot for a long time, as head coaches come and go.\nIt may seem obvious, but the longer an assistant stays in the NFL, the more connections they typically acquire. We found that some of the most connected people in our network \u2014 the ones with the most ties to different head coaches \u2014 were people with long tenures in the league.\nDanny Smith landed his first job in the NFL as a special teams coach was with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1995, where he worked with offensive coordinator Jon Gruden and Callahan, the offensive line coach. He moved to Detroit, then Buffalo, before settling in Washington from 2004-2012, where he worked for three different head coaches and assistants Shanahan, McVay and Morris. He later moved to Tomlin\u2019s staff in Pittsburgh, showing that good special teams coaches are never lack for work.\n\nRichard Mann, a veteran wide receivers coach who started in the NFL in 1982, also exemplifies the idea that longevity helps build connections. He has direct ties to 11 of the 15 coaches in the data set we built. He established most of his ties to Jon Gruden\u2019s coaching network while working in Tampa Bay from 2002-2009. He also has crossover ties to Lewis\u2019 coaching network, formed when he worked with Lewis on the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 staff in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\n5. Marvin Lewis keeps his people for a long time.\nLewis became the Bengals head coach in 2003, and he\u2019s earned a reputation for low staff turnover. When his assistants leave, it\u2019s usually because of a promotion to a better job elsewhere, or retirement. He rarely fires people.\nIn the visualization below, the orange relationship lines between Lewis and his assistants are thick because they spent so many years working together.\n\nCincinnati assistants like Darrin Simmons (special teams), Paul Guenther (defensive coordinator) and Jonathan Hayes (tight ends) have all been on Lewis\u2019 staff for 14 years, with little worry about job security. If an assistant sticks to a loyal coach who is unlikely to get fired \u2014 like Lewis \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing his job.\nThe lines connecting Jay Gruden to the network of Cincinnati assistants are much thinner, indicating weaker ties. It\u2019s notable that in Washington, he hasn\u2019t hired anyone from Lewis\u2019s Cincinnati staff.",

    "content": "BALTIMORE- Over the past two weeks, the Baltimore Ravens have received lots of criticism from fans and some public officials for kneeling during the national anthem before the Sept. 24th game against the Jacksonville Jaguars and kneeling and praying before the anthem ahead of Sunday\u2019s kickoff against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\u201cThey need to keep it out of the workplace,\u201d Hartford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cI would be the first one to support their right to protest outside of football, they just need to protect their brand of playing good football.\u201d\nBut Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott thinks the football field is the perfect place to protest inequalities and injustices people of color are facing across the country. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be tricked: this is about race, the thing we don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Scott said. \nIn the city where Francis Scott Key penned \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d the NFL players\u2019 show of protest, as in other cities, has roiled fans who agree with President Donald Trump that teams are disrespecting the anthem, the flag and the military. On the other side, players and their defenders insist their protests mean no disrespect but rather are being misinterpreted: the main point is to show support for social justice, to underscore concerns about police brutality, and to reaffirm the right to free expression despite criticism from the White House.\nTen Baltimore Ravens, including linebackers Terrell Suggs and C.J. Mosley, along with wide receiver Mike Wallace, took a knee and head coach John Harbaugh locked arms with the rest of his team before their game against Jacksonville in London. Former Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis also joined the team in taking a knee before the game.\nBefore Sunday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh, the entire Ravens team knelt before the anthem to pray, but stood for the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Their prayer was met with boos booming throughout the stadium and some fans even left after seeing players kneel.\nOnly 52 players nationwide took a knee during the anthem before last Sunday\u2019s games, a substantial drop from almost 200 players kneeling the previous week.\nTrump called for NFL team owners to fire the players that wouldn\u2019t stand for the anthem.\nRavens tight end Ben Watson took to Twitter the day before the Jacksonville game to respond to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\u201cIt is a sad day when the POTUS seeks to disregard and punish American citizens for peacefully exercising their constitutional rights,\u201d Watson tweeted.\nRavens owner Steve Bisciotti released a statement saying he supported his players \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing (that) it\u2019s getting talked about,\u201d Harbaugh said after the London game. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be painful. It\u2019s a tough conversation, but as for us here, I love our players and I support our players. A team is about unity.\u201d \nThe controversy was sparked more than a year ago when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality. \nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., responded to the recent protests by tweeting: \u201cDemocracy. Freedom of speech. Freedom of expression. The power of \u2018We the People\u2019 wanting to encourage a more perfect union.\u201d\nSome Ravens season ticket holders have even cancelled their season tickets. \nGeorge Reda, whose season seats went back to the days of the Baltimore Colts, wrote to Bisciotti that \u201cI know we all have the right in this great country to dissent and disagree with things that we don\u2019t agree with, but the football field is not the proper place.\u201d\nReda added he didn\u2019t even watch Sunday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh and took his Ravens sticker off his car.\nJoey Odoms, the Ravens\u2019 singer for the national anthem, resigned after the the Jaguars game \u2013 not because the team knelt but, he said, because of the hatred and disapproval sown to the team by the fans after the protest. \nOdoms, a former combat veteran, released a statement on Facebook explaining his decision to resign.\n\u201cFans who attack players for protesting, (a right in which I fought to defend) but are simply not interested in understanding why, is the reason I am resigning,\u201d Odoms said.\nGahler aired his displeasure at the kneeling on his Facebook page.\n\u201cThe embarrassment that is the NFL continues and people wonder why I am on strike\u201d against the league games, Gahler said. \u201cRavens join the nonsense of taking knee while on the soil of the Country we gained our independence from.\u201d\nGahler told CNS that when players are in uniform they constitute a team, not individuals.\n\u201cYou have \u00a0a First Amendment right outside your job but the NFL is endorsing it by allowing the disrespect of our flag,\u201d Gahler said.\nNo matter how the public perceives the Ravens stance, protesting players are not backing down.\n\u201cWe stand with our brothers. They have the right to protest and we knelt with them,\u201d Suggs said. \u201cNon-violent protest is as American as it gets. We knelt with them to let them know we\u2019re a unified front. There is no dividing us.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tim Frazier and Jodie Meeks, who joined the Washington Wizards this summer, will do more than share a backcourt this season. They\u2019re neighbors off the court, too. Frazier and Meeks moved into the same building this summer and live a few floors apart.\n\u201cWe hang out from time to time and play video games, try to get acquainted,\u201d said Meeks at the team\u2019s preseason media day Monday, adding they specifically play NBA 2K, Madden and FIFA. \u201cHe\u2019s my point guard now, so I want him to look for me as many times as possible.\u201d\nAway from virtual basketball and on the real hardcourt, Frazier (a point guard) and Meeks (shooting guard) need their acquaintance to develop into easy chemistry. Their new jobs are to back up Washington\u2019s star guards, John Wall and Bradley Beal. The Wizards hope the two new arrivals will provide more stability to their second-string backcourt and improve their bench production in 2017 and beyond.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re off to a good start,\u201d Frazier said.\nLast season, Wall and Beal were generally relieved by point guard Trey Burke (12.3 minutes per game in 57 appearances) and shooting guard Marcus Thornton (17.4 minutes per game in 33 appearances). The Wizards also signed point guard Brandon Jennings in March, who helped through the late-season push and the playoffs. None of those players are on the squad this year.\nTo take their places, the Wizards traded their second-round draft pick (52nd overall) to New Orleans to acquire Frazier, then signed Meeks to a two-year deal in free agency.\nWashington\u2019s non-starters were among the league\u2019s least productive last season. The team was second-worst in total bench minutes, points and assists; 25th of 30 teams in bench points per 36 minutes (63.4); and 24th in bench assists per 36 minutes (12.8), according to realgm.com. (Judging by 36 minutes is a way to measure production per minute played, rather than per game.)\nThe Wizards\u2019 need for better bench production didn\u2019t seem lost on Frazier.\n\u201cI think it goes the whole way with our second unit,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cObviously, I will have the ball in my hands, so I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for everybody, how they work, how they feel, where they want the ball and whatever I can do to help the team win.\u201d\nIf Meeks scores and Frazier distributes the ball the way they did for their previous teams, that overall bench production ought to improve. Frazier is more of a traditional passing point guard, in contrast with the man he\u2019s replacing, Burke, a scorer. Frazier averaged 7.9 assists per 36 minutes for the Pelicans last season, much higher than Burke\u2019s 5.1 per 36.\nWizards head coach Scott Brooks said he considers Frazier, who entered the NBA as an undrafted free agent, \u201cas tough a competitor as there is in the league\u201d after spending time around him during the summer.\nMeeks, meanwhile, scored 16.0 points per 36 minutes for the Orlando Magic last year, a better mark than Thornton\u2019s 13.7 and Burke\u2019s 14.6 for Washington. Meeks is also known for his touch beyond the arc, so he can maintain the Wizards\u2019 supply of three-pointers whenever he enters for Beal.\n\u201cJodie Meeks is one of the best shooters in the game,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s had some unfortunate injuries the last few years. Hopefully we can keep him healthy and on the court. If you can do that, he spaces the floor as well as anybody in the league. He\u2019s a 40 percent three-point shooter and he can knock down four or five in a quarter.\u201d\nTo be precise, Meeks shot .409 from three for Orlando last year and averaged .388 over the last four seasons. That\u2019s useful compared to the 2016-17 league average of .358 and Thornton\u2019s mark last season of .350.\nMeeks and Frazier also outstrip the former Wizards in the advanced metrics of \u201coffensive rating,\u201d which estimates how many points a player produces in 100 possessions, and \u201cdefensive rating,\u201d which estimates how many points a player allows per 100 possessions.\n\n\nMeeks\u2019 107 offensive rating essentially means he is five percent more productive on offense than Thornton was. Frazier, with his three years of NBA experience, replaces the two-man band-aid of Burke and Jennings at the cost of a late-second-round pick. And this doesn\u2019t come at the expense of defense, as Meeks and Frazier fall in the same range of defensive rating as their predecessors.\nHaving a more productive bench would make Washington\u2019s starters\u2019 lives more comfortable. Forward Otto Porter Jr. is excited for the additions.\n\u201cJodie brings a lot to the table. He\u2019s a veteran guy, a professional, the three-point shooter that we need,\u201d Porter said. \u201cTim, he\u2019s a guy that has great experience. As a backup for John, he\u2019s gonna do great.\u201d\nPorter said he and his teammates have had some time to get to know Frazier and Meeks during the offseason.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got guys that can come in and impact the game off the bat,\u201d Porter said. \u201cJust playing with them over the summer, you can kinda already tell that they\u2019re picking (things) up, getting close to guys, and we\u2019re making it easy for them to transition to helping this team.\u201d",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 When the head coach of the United States Hockey League\u2019s Youngstown Phantoms picked up the team\u2019s newest player \u2014 Nathan Walker, a little-known Australian who had been playing in the Czech Republic \u2014 at the airport in 2013, Walker had been on a nearly 24-hour-trip from Prague to Warsaw to New York City to Cleveland.\nBoarding the team bus for an 8-hour ride from Cleveland to a game that night in Chicago, the coach, Anthony Noreen, assured Walker he wasn\u2019t expected to play because of jet lag.\n\u201cHe pretty much looked at me and said, \u2018Coach, I came here to play hockey,\u2019\u201d said Noreen, who provided details of Walker\u2019s trip in an interview. \u201cLike, \u2018I\u2019m ready, you don\u2019t ever have to worry about me being ready no matter the situation.\u2019\u201d\nThat night, Noreen penciled Walker into the lineup for his first USHL game against the Chicago Steel. And on his very shift, Walker scored, splitting two Steel players at the blue line before blowing past another defender on his way to the goal.\n\n\u201cI just think from the second he got there he had a mission,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cHis mission was to play in the NHL and he just wasn\u2019t going to be denied.\u201d\nFour years later, after logging thousands of miles in the American Hockey League and coming back from two season-ending injuries, the 23-year-old forward is on the verge of making the Washington Capitals\u2019 opening-night roster.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give everything I can to make the team,\u201d Walker said at the team\u2019s media day earlier this month. \u201cIf it happens, it happens. If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll just keep working until eventually, hopefully it [does].\u201d\nPassed over completely in the 2012 and 2013 drafts, the five-foot-nine Walker was selected by Washington with the 89th pick in his final draft-eligible year. Walker has showcased his speed and penalty-killing ability during the preseason, emerging as a compelling candidate to make the team. Should he, Walker would become the first ever Australian to play in the NHL.\nWalker was born in Cardiff, Great Britain, but raised in Australia after his family relocated when he was two-years-old. After seeing the Mighty Ducks movies and watching his older brother play ice hockey, Walker took up the sport. As a teenager, he convinced his parents to let him move overseas in order to play more often and against tougher competition.\nHe spent parts of six seasons playing in the Czech Republic before joining Youngstown for the second half of their season.\n\u201cWhen you find out his story, that he moved away from home into a foreign country where he didn\u2019t speak the language at the age of 15 and he was living on his own to play hockey and chase his dream, obviously he\u2019s going to be a little bit more mature than your average 18-year-old, 19-year-old,\u201d Noreen said.\nWalker played 29 games with the Phantoms, scoring 27 points before a broken bone in his neck ended his season. Walker acclimated to the Youngstown locker room so quickly that his teammates unanimously voted him team captain for the following year.\n\u201cAnytime it\u2019s a guy like that, no matter where you\u2019re from and what the cultural difference is, I think when you play that hard and you work that hard, guys seem to look up to you and guys tend to want to bring you into the group pretty quickly,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cHe was part of the group almost instantly.\u201d\nAfter attending Capitals development camp and training camp on a tryout basis, Walker ultimately never returned to Youngstown, accepting a contract with Washington\u2019s AHL affiliate in Hershey for the 2013-2014 season. He scored 11 points in 43 games with the Bears, prompting the Capitals to trade back into the third round of the 2014 draft to pick him.\nExcluding an injury-shortened season in 2015, in which he tore his ACL, Walker\u2019s numbers have steadily climbed, culminating with a career-best 17 goals and 24 assists in 2016. Walker was being considered for his first NHL call-up last January during the NHL All-Star break, according to Capitals head coach Barry Trotz, until he broke his hand blocking a shot.\nWalker, who is listed at 186 pounds, is undersized compared to the NHL average, but employs a high-energy and physical style of play. The Australian scored the lone goal in the Capitals\u2019 first preseason game against New Jersey Sept. 18.\n\u201cHe just continues to become a better player,\u201d Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said at the team\u2019s media day earlier this month. \u201cBetter positionally, reads the game better, more intelligent on his reads, instead of being a pure energy player.\u201d\nFor the first time in two years, the Capitals have spots available in their lineup entering training camp after six players left the team during the offseason. Walker is competing for one of the two expected openings on the fourth line alongside center Jay Beagle. The Capitals trimmed down their roster to 30 players Tuesday, with Walker still in Washington.\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re just around guys when you coach long enough and play long enough, you\u2019re just around certain guys where you just know that they\u2019re going to find a way somehow to make it,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cAnd there was no doubt that after spending a couple days around him and especially the rest of that season, that he was going to be one of those guys that would find a way to make it.\u201d",

The next morning, Trump tweeted that he had rescinded the NBA champion Golden State Warriors\u2019 invitation to the White House after Steph Curry decided to abstain from meeting the president.\nBeal was the most outspoken of the Wizards. In a tweet Saturday, Beal used a clown emoji when questioning Trump\u2019s decision to uninvite the Warriors.\n\nHow you gonna withdraw an invite that somebody already said they weren\u2019t attending? ??\n\u2014 Bradley Beal (@RealDealBeal23) September 23, 2017\n\nIn front of the media on Monday at Capital One Arena, Beal stuck to the metaphor and went further.\n\u201cTo me, you\u2019re a clown,\u201d he said of the president. \u201cTo do something like this, that\u2019s unacceptable. That\u2019s not what a leader does. Your job is supposed to bring everybody together, and everybody in the world feels that since you got in office, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d\nThe 24-year-old shooting guard also said Trump had more important things to worry about.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of issues going on in the world, like Puerto Rico doesn\u2019t have water and power (due to Hurricane Maria) and they\u2019re still part of the U.S., but you\u2019re worried about guys kneeling during the national anthem,\u201d Beal said.\nWall, Washington\u2019s star point guard, followed Beal in criticizing the president.\n\u201cI don\u2019t respect him. I feel like you can\u2019t control what people want to do, and we have bigger issues in this world that you need to be focusing on instead of focusing on all these people taking a knee,\u201d Wall said. \u201cIt means something more important. They\u2019re doing it for a reason, and you can\u2019t do nothing but respect their decision.\u201d\nWizards\u2019 head coach Scott Brooks, entering his second season with the franchise, said he hadn\u2019t yet talked with the team about the issue or the possibility of team-wide anthem actions this season. He indicated that any decision will be a unanimous one.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s stronger when you do it in a group, in a group setting. Whatever we decide on, we\u2019ll do it together,\u201d Brooks said.\nCenter Marcin Gortat, a native of Poland, was initially reluctant to offer his opinion on the matter. When pressed, he defended athletes\u2019 right to protest and encouraged his peers to use their platform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are random people in the streets,\u201d Gortat said. \u201cPeople buy tickets to the games. They come and watch us, they admire us. Some of us have a few million followers on Instagram, Twitter and the other social media. I truly believe we have an impact in the community, and if somebody wants to speak up, he can speak up.\u201d\nGortat\u2019s point about athletes\u2019 platforms echoed Beal, who said he would never \u201cgo back on\u201d his statements about Trump.\n\u201cSometimes whether athletes realize it or not, we\u2019re role models,\u201d Beal said. \u201cPeople view our voices as having more power and say-so than probably the rest of the world, because people look up to us as athletes and they see us on TV every day.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel like we have a powerful voice in one way or another,\u201d Beal added. \u201cSo if I can reach one person, that\u2019s everything.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Baltimore Orioles are the only Major League Baseball team that did not sign any international players this summer, lagging behind a trend where over 350 international players were signed by other teams. The team's focus remains predominantly on domestic talent, influenced by ownership and management philosophy, making it easier to invest in well-scouted U.S.-based prospects.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 The Baltimore Orioles are lagging way behind the rest of Major League Baseball in signing international players, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nAs the game becomes increasingly global, the Orioles were the lone team in the majors not to dip into the international market this summer, per Baseball America. Conversely, the San Diego Padres signed a league-high 34 international players, and the Orioles\u2019 American League East rival Boston Red Sox inked 31.\nMore than 350 international players signed contracts with major league teams this summer, according to Baseball America. Most of these players are from Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, but signees also come from places like the Bahamas, Australia and the Netherlands.\n\n\nBaltimore, however, has consistently shied away from the international market.\nOf the 12 Orioles position players to appear in at least 60 games this season, only Jonathan Schoop is an international signing, coming out of Curacao in 2008. Only two of the 12 most used pitchers on the team were international signings \u2013 Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez and Miguel Castro \u2013 and neither were originally signed by Baltimore. Anthony Santander, originally signed out of Venezuela by Cleveland in 2011, is the only international representative in the Orioles\u2019 top ten prospects, according to mlbpipeline.com.\nThe team\u2019s domestic focus can be traced to the philosophy of the team\u2019s ownership and management. For the Orioles, it may be easier to convince owner Peter Angelos to pay the signing bonus for a well-scouted high school or college draftee such as Manny Machado, than to dish out money for a little-known Dominican or Venezuelan player, said Jeffrey Paternostro, a senior prospect writer for Baseball Prospectus.\n\u201cEvery team has a budget, both for the major league team and player development, and they have to decide where to allocate those resources,\u201d Paternostro said. \u201cTeams like the Yankees and Padres have been very aggressive in [the international] market\u2026but there are some teams, like the White Sox before and the Orioles now, that just will not spend money there.\u201d\nUnlike U.S. and Canadian high school and college players, foreign-born players are not eligible for the MLB draft that is held every June. Instead, they are eligible to sign free agent contracts with teams starting as young as 16.\nSigning players that young can be a gamble, Paternostro said, but one that many teams are willing to take.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know what a 16-year-old is going to look like physically at 22. It\u2019s not easy at 18 either for [high school] players, but you have two more years of information and a better amateur track record to go on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you\u2019re getting them earlier, so you can get them into your system earlier.\u201d\nThe signing window opens each year on July 2, and each team starts with a bonus pool of $4.75 million to sign international players, while low-revenue and small market teams have a chance to begin with up to $5.75 million, as laid out in MLB\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\nTeams can use this money to sign international free agents that are younger than 25 and have fewer than six years of foreign professional experience. Or they can choose to trade their funds away to other teams, as the Orioles have done recently.\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, they have traded away international bonus money on nine different occasions this year. Only one of the players they\u2019ve received in return has seen the majors this season: Jeremy Hellickson, who has a 7.29 ERA in nine starts since coming to Baltimore from the Phillies on July 29.\nThe Orioles declined to comment. But General Manager Dan Duquette explained the reasoning behind the trades to the Baltimore Sun in August.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been utilizing the international slot money to help us acquire some pitching to help our team,\u201d Duquette told the Sun. \u201cA lot of the other clubs will invest it in pitching to help us in the future or players to help us in the future. We use it to try to strengthen our pitching staff now while we have a window of opportunity with the position players we have here. That\u2019s just utilizing a trade resource to impact your team now rather than three, four, five years down the road.\u201d\n\n\nBaltimore stands to miss out by avoiding the international market, as these signings can turn into some of the game\u2019s best players. Houston Astros\u2019 second baseman Jose Altuve, the MLB position player leader in WAR (Wins Above Replacement) per Fangraphs, was signed as an international free agent out of Venezuela in 2007. Jose Ramirez, the young star at the center of the surging Cleveland Indians, signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. Schoop has been the Orioles\u2019 best player this season, leading the team in WAR, OPS, batting average and RBIs.\nIn fact, of the 70 MLB All-Stars in 2017, 17 of them originally signed as international free agents. On the whole, 32 percent of the league is international. The future of the game is increasingly global, too. As of September, six of the top ten mlbpipeline.com prospects have international origins.\nThe Orioles have made the postseason three times since 2012, but sit seven games under .500 and five and a half out of a playoff spot as of September 21. For a team with a farm system that consistently ranks in the lower third of baseball, and the impending free agency of Adam Jones and Manny Machado, they are seemingly on the brink of a rebuild. Whether or not they choose to invest in international talent as a part of this remains to be seen.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A curse has tormented sports fans in Washington since its NFL football franchise\u2019s Super Bowl victory in 1992 \u2013 but baseball fans in the nation\u2019s capital have suffered for even longer. \nWashington hasn\u2019t seen a World Series championship since 1924. It didn\u2019t help that the city had no baseball team from 1972 until the arrival of the Nationals in 2005. The Nats have made the playoffs three times each time with home-field advantage in the divisional series, only to squander each opportunity. \nTheir 89-57 record as of Sept. 15 puts them just 5.5 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers for the National League\u2019s top spot, despite facing a 14-game deficit less than three weeks ago. With Los Angeles reeling and coming into town this weekend, Washington could make serious headway in obtaining home-field advantage once again throughout the playoffs.\n\nThis year, however, some Nationals fans believe their team is poised to come away with more than just the participation trophies they earned in 2012, 2014 and 2016. \nSally Adams is a 64-year-old St. Louis native who has lived in northern Virginia for 30 years, and has since become a Nationals fan. She said seeing her new team lose to her childhood Cardinals in 2012 spurred her to continue buying tickets.  \n\u201cI think this is the year,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have had all the tools\u2026They have to do it this year. There would be no excuses if they can\u2019t move forward. I know it\u2019s a game, but c\u2019mon.\u201d\nBarring a late-season injury, the Nationals will have Stephen Strasburg, who has only pitched in one postseason game in his career because of a controversial innings limit in 2012 and an elbow injury last year. \nStrasburg\u2019s presence will be a welcome one. He joins Max Scherzer and Gio Gonzalez in the top four in the league in opponent batting average against and top 10 in left-on-base percentage.\nThough it\u2019s unclear when Bryce Harper will return, the Nationals have thrived in his absence, and could still very well be an October threat without him.\nEven without Harper\u2019s bat for 39 games, the Nationals remain tied for 5th in the league with a wRC+ of 101, their best such mark in their four division title years. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are fourth in the league with a mark of 104. wRC+, according to mlb.com, is a variation of Runs Created that adjusts \u201cto account for important external factors \u2014 like ballpark or era.\u201d\nHarper, who has been sidelined since Aug. 13 with a knee injury, has posted MVP-caliber splits this season (.326 BA/29 HR/87 RBI), but Washington has still mustered an 18-11 record in his absence.\nIt\u2019s that depth that has 58-year-old season-ticket holder Chuck Workman excited.\n\u201cThese guys just never seem to give up, no matter who they put in,\u201d Workman said. \u201cAnd you just get the feeling \u2013 every game when I\u2019m sitting in there I get the feeling they\u2019re going to win. If they\u2019re down, they\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\nLifelong Washington baseball fan Vyron Johnson also expressed optimism about the Nats\u2019 playoff chances, even in the face of Harper\u2019s uncertain status, citing the team\u2019s improved bullpen.\n\nIn the first half of the season, Washington\u2019s relievers ranked 29th in the league in Fielding Independent Pitching, a pitching metric that aims to diminish a defense\u2019s impact on a pitcher\u2019s season. But since the All-Star game, the Nats have been fifth-best in that category, according to FanGraphs. \nFielding Independent Pitching values high strikeout rates, and is most negatively affected by walks and home runs surrendered.\nGiven the Dodgers\u2019 recent slide, the National League suddenly appears up for grabs, and this weekend could reveal much about the Nationals\u2019 chances to win the pennant.\nJohnson, 65, said he expects the Dodgers series to have a playoff feel to it and for the D.C. faithful to make their voices heard in Nationals Park this weekend. He said that in past seasons, Nationals fans could hardly be heard over the roars of fans cheering for opposing teams. \nNow? \u201cI think we\u2019re drowning them out,\u201d Johnson said with a smile.  \nJohnson predicted that if the Nationals were to win the World Series, Washington residents will \u201cparty all year long like (Chicago) did\u201d following the Cubs\u2019 World Series victory last year. \nYou know what they say\u2026party like it\u2019s 1924.",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech's use of the flexbone triple option offense, which nearly upset Tennessee, highlights its effectiveness as an equalizer in an era dominated by pass-first offenses. Navy, under Ken Niumatalolo, remains the most successful team running this system, emphasizing the importance of both the scheme and strong coaching.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 On college football\u2019s opening weekend, an old-school offensive system was on display yet again.\nGeorgia Tech brought 25th-ranked Tennessee to two overtimes and lost 42-41 only when they failed to make a game-winning two-point conversion. The Yellow Jackets became the fifth team since 2000 to lose a game despite gaining 500 yards rushing.\nIn an age of pass-first offenses, Georgia Tech is the only Power Five program to run the flexbone triple option offense. The system has been favored for decades by head coach Paul Johnson, who brought the philosophy to Atlanta from Navy \u2014 the Annapolis program which has been the winningest Division I team to run the fast-paced, run-heavy system.\nJohnson drew doubt across the country when Tech hired him in 2008, but in short order the flexbone was up and running at the Atlantic Coast Conference program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something we\u2019ve done for a long time and believe in and have had a lot of success doing at different schools,\u201d Johnson said this week. \u201cI used to wonder why more people didn\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s certainly a great equalizer and gives you a chance to be competitive, but to each their own.\u201d\nOnly seven Football Bowl Subdivision programs employ some version of the flexbone triple option: Georgia Tech, Navy, Army, Air Force, Georgia Southern, New Mexico and Tulane. Army beat Fordham 64-6 last Friday without completing a single pass. At New Mexico, after head coach Bob Davie arrived in 2012 and installed his version of the offense, the team snapped a seven-year bowl drought and appeared in bowl games in 2015 and 2016. But the winningest flexbone team of this generation is Navy, where Johnson had his first Division I FBS head coaching job from 2002 to 2007.\nNavy head coach Ken Niumatalolo has been in charge since Johnson\u2019s move to Tech. He believes credit for the Midshipmen\u2019s success should go to the personnel and coaching as much as the system.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of everything. It all stems from the players, but it\u2019s an offense that works,\u201d Niumatalolo said this week.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather just win\u201d\nThe flexbone employs three running backs: a fullback behind the quarterback and two slotbacks called the \u201cA-back\u201d and \u201cB-back\u201d on either side of them. The quarterback can give the fullback a handoff up the middle (option one), he can carry the ball himself (option two) or he can pitch it to one of the slotbacks (option three). Flexbone offenses rely mainly on these choices and rarely throw the ball.\nIt goes by several names \u2014 Johnson refers to his system as the \u201cspread\u201d offense \u2014 but the term \u201cflexbone\u201d was coined by longtime Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry when he said he wanted his team to be more flexible in the wishbone formation, as Steve Gunther tells the story. Gunther has self-published several instructional books about coaching the flexbone and learned under Emory Bellard, who coached the system at Texas A&M and Mississippi State.\n\u201cEmory always used to say, \u2018These teams that throw for touchdowns all the time\u2026 for some reason those touchdowns, in the minds of the fans, count for more points,\u2019\u201d Gunther said. \u201c\u2018The last time I looked, it still counts six points (to run for a touchdown).\u2019\u201d\nNiumatalolo agreed, saying that the lack of passing didn\u2019t make the flexbone a \u201cgimmick\u201d offense.\n\u201cI think everybody wants to see the ball in the air,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cI think sometimes athletic directors would rather see somebody throw the ball 50 times, and maybe feel like the fans want to see the ball thrown and not run, but I\u2019d rather just win.\u201d\nAnd teams like Navy certainly win. The seven FBS flexbone programs combined to go 54-36 in 2016, a .600 winning percentage, with five of the seven making bowl games. Johnson made the case for the advantage teams receive when they try something different.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the conference with Ohio State and Michigan and some of those schools, you\u2019re not gonna out-recruit those schools,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo you better not be doing the same thing they\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\u201d\nTim Stowers, an offensive assistant under Paul Johnson at Georgia Southern in 1985 and 1986 and the author of \u201cCoaching Football\u2019s Spread Offense,\u201d put it another way.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have superior talent, it allows you to move the ball against superior personnel,\u201d he said.\nThis fits the bill for service academies, which are at a disadvantage recruiting against other programs because of the post-graduation military service requirement. Also, because cadets and midshipmen must make a certain weight to pass physical readiness tests for graduation, the academies rarely have 300-pound linemen like most schools do. The flexbone prioritizes mobility over size on the offensive line because linemen must keep blocking for their runners as the play moves down the field. in the second layers of defenses.\nNiumatalolo clarified that his offense doesn\u2019t require \u201csmall\u201d linemen, saying Navy\u2019s are bigger now than they have ever been.\n\u201cYou have to be nimble, but to play anything in football nowadays on the [offensive line], we\u2019re looking for guys that can move,\u201d he said.\nNavy\u2019s starting offensive linemen for opening weekend averaged 287 pounds a man; in contrast, at the University of Maryland, which does not run the option, the average starter on the line opening weekend was 312 pounds. Johnson\u2019s recruits at Georgia Tech don\u2019t have to worry about making graduation weight the way Navy\u2019s do, yet the coach still uses slightly lighter offensive linemen: His opening day starters averaged out to 287 pounds, the same as Navy\u2019s.\nMobile Midshipmen\nThe height of the flexbone\u2019s popularity came in the 1970s, both Gunther and Stowers said, when Oklahoma and Alabama won national titles running it. In the 21st century, Navy has been the preeminent flexbone team.\nIn 2016, the Midshipmen scored 37.9 points per game, the highest total of all seven teams that run the flexbone, and they led the country with a whopping 61 rushing touchdowns compared to just nine passing touchdowns. Runs accounted for 87 percent of their offensive touchdowns, the widest discrepancy in FBS football.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Navy ran the ball the most often \u2014 Air Force led the country in rushing attempts in 2016 (810, when stats are adjusted so sacks aren\u2019t counted as rushing attempts). With that same adjustment, Army had the widest ratio of rushes to pass attempts \u2014 780 to 123 \u2014 meaning they called a run play 85.4 percent of the time. Navy was third in both categories.\nStill, Navy has won games with the flexbone the most consistently. Since 2008 \u2014 Johnson\u2019s first season at Georgia Tech and Niumatalolo\u2019s first year as head coach of Navy \u2014 the Midshipmen have been far and away the winningest service academy, finishing worse than 8-5 only once in nine seasons. With a winning percentage of .653, they edge out Georgia Tech\u2019s .611 over the same span.\nDuring that time period, Navy\u2019s competition only became tougher; the academy shifted from an independent to a football-only member of the American Athletic Conference in 2015, and they\u2019ve won four of eight bowl games they\u2019ve appeared in, including games against Power Five opponents Missouri and Pittsburgh.\n\u201cIt gives us the opportunity to win against people that, really, we have no business beating,\u201d Niumatalolo said.\nThis Saturday Navy faces conference foe Tulane. Niumatalolo said Tulane coach Willie Fritz\u2019s flexbone is slightly different than Navy\u2019s, as it operates from a zone-blocking scheme with receivers spread wide. The Midshipmen\u2019s coach, meanwhile, believes his team benefits from running hard up the middle.\n\u201cWhere people are zone-blocking, going east and west, we\u2019re going north and south,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting up the field, we\u2019re attacking people. So yes, schematically what we do is sound, but I feel like the physicality in how we do things also separates us.\u201d\nStowers believes some coaches \u201care scared of being labeled as an option coach\u201d for its stigma as a gimmick. A decade into Niumatalolo\u2019s tenure in Annapolis and Georgia Tech\u2019s flexbone journey with Johnson, it\u2019s clear some option coaches just plan to stick with what works for them.",

These departures account for a significant portion of the team's previous success, with only minimal reinforcements brought in to fill the void.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Following the Capitals\u2019 offseason exodus, the NHL\u2019s best regular-season team for the past two seasons could have a hard time replicating its recent dominance in the standings.\nDue to salary cap restraints, Washington was forced to let Karl Alzner, Kevin Shattenkirk and Justin Williams leave during free agency, and trade Marcus Johansson after a career year. The Capitals also lost defenseman Nate Schmidt in the expansion draft and chose not to resign fourth-line winger Daniel Winnik.\nIn total, these six players accounted for approximately 23 percent of the standing points the Capitals registered last season. But the team only acquired one fringe NHL player in an attempt to replace their value.\nThe NHL awards a team two points for a win of any kind, one point for an overtime or shootout loss and zero points for a regulation loss. The Capitals finished last season with 118 points, a league high by seven points.\nPoint Shares, an advanced metric, estimates the number of points in the standings an individual player contributed to a team. Last season, the team\u2019s 30 players combined for a total of 122.1 Point Shares, according to Hockey Reference. Alzner, Shattenkirk, Williams, Johansson, Schmidt and Winnik accounted for 28.1 Point Shares.\n\nAlthough past Point Shares are not an exact indicator of how a team will perform, it can underscore the Capitals\u2019 roster deficiencies entering the season.\nFor the past three seasons the Capitals have been in win-now mode, acquiring high-end talent, while players like Evgeny Kuznetsov and Dmitry Orlov were signed to inexpensive contracts, to help Washington win their first Stanley Cup.\nBut after the Capitals were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round of the playoffs for a second consecutive year, general manager Brian MacLellan\u2019s self-imposed championship window expired. They entered the summer with nine regular players needing new contracts and not nearly enough money to go around.\nIn July, MacLellan likened the Capitals\u2019 significant roster turnover to a Stanley Cup-winning team maneuvering around the salary cap post-championship parade. It was an apt comparison, minus the championship part.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last three years building that team to where it was last year, and we maxed it out, both player-wise and salary-wise,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cAnd I think we were expecting to run into some issues here going forward. I think it\u2019s no different than the teams that have won in the past. We have the same kind of hangover, but we haven\u2019t won a championship and we\u2019re dealing with it now.\u201d\nLike the Capitals this year, the Chicago Blackhawks could not afford to retain important personnel after Stanley Cup wins in 2010 and 2015, resulting in major roster retooling.\nBut unlike the Blackhawks, the Capitals did not have the cap space to replace their departed players with established NHLers. T.J. Oshie and the team\u2019s youngest talent were due significant pay raises, preventing other moves.\nAs a result, the Capitals\u2019 only summer acquisition was Devante Smith-Pelly, who had a -0.3 Point Share last season, with prospects expected to fill out the rest of the roster.\nThe Blackhawks maximized their resources en route to their first Stanley Cup in 47 seasons in 2010, and proceeded to gut the roster to stay under the salary cap. Chicago cut ties with 10 players that summer, including future all-star Dustin Byfuglien, losing 32.2 Point Shares.\nBlackhawks general manager Stan Bowman\u2019s offseason acquisitions had 18.7 Point Shares in the previous season, with newly-signed backup goalie Marty Turco credited with nearly half of them, but Chicago still suffered a net loss of 13.5 Point Shares. That led to a 15-point decline in the standings, as the team dropped from 112 points in 2010 to 97 in 2011.\nAfter their third championship in six years in 2015, the Blackhawks underwent more roster changes. Eight players \u2014 accounting for 24.6 Point Shares \u2014 left Chicago, but the Blackhawks were able to recoup 13.5 Point Shares through offseason acquisitions. (They gained an additional 7 Point Shares with mid-season acquisitions).\nAs a result, the Blackhawks suffered a net loss of 4.1 Point Shares, but still finished 2016 a point better than they did in 2015. The Blackhawks were able to exceed expectations set by Point Shares with the free-agent signing of Artemi Panarin, who went on to register 9.8 Point Shares that season and win the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.\nIf the Capitals hope to maintain their typical level of regular season excellence, as the 2016 Blackhawks did, they will need to replace the 28.1 Point Shares they lost in the offseason. But with little NHL-level experience being brought in to recover their loss, the Capitals could take a significant stumble down the standings in 2017-2018.",

    "summary": "Many NFL teams are signing average quarterbacks to high-salary contracts despite their performance not matching that of top-tier players like Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. This trend continues with recent contracts for Matthew Stafford and Derek Carr, who have been paid at elite levels despite inconsistent or mediocre performance metrics over the past few seasons.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland\u2013In today\u2019s passing-heavy NFL, many front offices are signing their quarterbacks to lucrative deals.\nBut many of these players are earning elite salaries despite not ranking among the best at their position, while many top quarterbacks earn lesser salaries, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nWashington\u2019s Kirk Cousins and Baltimore\u2019s Joe Flacco are among the highest paid quarterbacks in the NFL, but they do not produce at the same level that top passers, such as Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, do.\nIn fact, of the ten highest paid quarterbacks, only four of them \u2014 Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers), Drew Brees (New Orleans Saints), Russell Wilson (Seattle Seahawks) and Ben Roethlisberger (Pittsburgh Steelers) \u2014 have an average QBR (Total Quarterback Rating) above 68 in the last four seasons. Two, Flacco and Derek Carr (Oakland Raiders), failed to break 60.\n\nThe trend of overpaying mediocre quarterbacks shows no sign of slowing down, either.\nOn August 28, the Detroit Lions and Matthew Stafford agreed to a five-year, $135 million contract extension, according to multiple media reports, worth an average of $27 million per year, making the 29-year old quarterback the highest paid player in the NFL. This comes on the heels of Carr\u2019s contract $25 million per year contract extension, which set a record when he signed it in June.\nStafford posted a 70.5 QBR last season, good for eighth in the NFL but well behind Matt Ryan\u2019s league-best 83.3 mark. He owns a 58.9 QBR over the last four seasons, and is 0-3 in playoff games.\nLike Stafford, Cousins and Flacco are among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league, each making over $22 million a year. Cousins is coming off a strong 2017 in which he threw for nearly 5,000 yards and 25 touchdowns, while ranking in the top third of the league with a 71.7 QBR. He and the Washington front office are at an impasse over contract talks, so he is playing this season under a second consecutive franchise tag worth $23.9 million in hopes of an even more lucrative contract next year.\nLast seasons, Flacco eclipsed 4,000 passing yards for the first time in his nine-year career, but struggled otherwise. He threw nearly as many interceptions as he did touchdowns, and his 58.4 QBR ranked in the bottom half of the league. Nevertheless, he makes $22.1 million per year, sixth most in the NFL.\nMeanwhile, some of the best passers in the league don\u2019t get paid elite salaries. Matt Ryan (Atlanta Falcons) and Tom Brady (New England Patriots), who faced off in the Super Bowl in February, ranked first and second, respectively, in QBR last season. However, neither of them crack the top ten in salary, instead sitting 14th and 15th, respectively, squarely in the middle of the pack.\nWhat accounts for this? Are Flacco and Stafford really worth more than Brady and Rodgers?\nSome of it can be chalked up to timing. Flacco signed a six-year, $120 million extension with the Ravens in March 2013, just one month after winning a Super Bowl. Carr\u2019s extension came after he led the Raiders to their first winning season and playoff berth since 2002. Despite not posting earth-shattering numbers, these quarterbacks conveniently signed contract extensions after their best performances of their career.\nSome teams pay high prices for a quarterback, knowing that the alternative is bleak.\nThe year before drafting Stafford, the Lions went 0-16. While the 2009 first-overall pick hasn\u2019t enjoyed playoff success, his Lions have earned three playoff berths in the last six years after a stretch of ten straight losing seasons prior to that. In Cousins\u2019 first two full years as a starter, he has led Washington to back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since the 1990s.\nQuarterback is a premium position in the NFL. As teams such as the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers know, finding a dependable passer is easier said than done. While none of the aforementioned passers rank in the upper tier with Brady and Rodgers, teams would still rather break the bank on them than risk returning to their losing ways.",

Despite leading in home runs since 2011, the team's low walk rate risks fewer baserunners, often resulting in solo home runs.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette\u2019s watch, the Orioles have formed a successful lineup that hits many home runs and draws few walks.\nWhile this offensive approach helped lead the Orioles to the American League Championship Series in 2014 and American League wild card game in 2016, it was also part of the reason why the team didn\u2019t advance further in those years.\nThe Orioles are only one of many teams who\u2019ve decided to value home runs more, but they are against the grain when it comes to devaluing walks. Baltimore has pursued this approach partially because they trust their players to put together strong at bats even if they don\u2019t end in walks.\n\u201dYou don\u2019t necessarily have to walk to gain something from [the at bat],\u201d Showalter said in a 2016 media session. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a guy make an eight pitch, nine pitch at bat and make an out, but he won that at bat.\u201d\nThe Orioles aggressive approach has helped them hit the most home runs in baseball since 2011. They have the eighth-best winning percentage in that span, and they\u2019ve won with the league\u2019s second-worst walk rate and fifth-worst on-base percentage. By not drawing walks, the Orioles risk not getting as many baserunners as other teams, which results in them hitting more solo home runs than most teams.\nBaltimore has put together a lineup dominated by right-handed power hitters like Manny Machado, Adam Jones and Jonathan Schoop. In 2017, the team has hit a home run once every 22.6 at bats, second-best in baseball. They finished first in that category in 2014 and 2016, when the Orioles made the playoffs, and they finished third in 2015.\nDespite this tremendous power, the Orioles don\u2019t have as much patience. While Baltimore\u2019s aggressive approach leads to home runs, it also means the team walks less than the rest of the league.\nSince Showalter\u2019s first full season, Baltimore has only walked 7.1 percent of the time, second-worst to only Kansas City. When the Orioles made the playoffs in 2014 and 2016, they had a below-average 6.6 and 7.7 walk percentage. In 2017, Baltimore has only walked 6.5 percent of the time, tied for last in baseball.\n\nA big reason for building an aggressive, right-handed heavy lineup is the ballpark in which they play. Since right-handed power bats can take advantage of hitter-friendly Camden Yards, seven of the Orioles\u2019 everyday players are righties who have an aggressive approach, resulting in a high home run and low walk rate.\nDue to this strategy, the Orioles front office decided to let some key players go in free agency. Nick Markakis leaving to sign with Atlanta stands out the most.\nMarkakis, who played nine years with the team, has a career 10.5 walk percentage, but is a lefty who only hits a homer once every 42.7 at bats, and didn\u2019t fit the mold of what plays well at Camden.\nSince leaving Baltimore, Markakis has averaged a 10.3 walk percentage for the Atlanta Braves, surpassing double digits in each of the past three seasons. In all of Markakis\u2019 full seasons playing for Showalter, his highest walk percentage was 8.9. Markakis\u2019 career high walk percentage: 14.2, which he posted in 2008, before Showalter arrived.\nA year later, the Orioles traded for Mark Trumbo, who has walked 6.8 percent of the time and hit a homerun every 18 at bats over his career. After Trumbo hit 47 home runs for Baltimore in 2016, he signed a three-year, $37 million deal with the team, close to Markakis\u2019 four-year, $44 million deal with the Braves.\nThis past offseason, the Orioles signed catcher Welington Castillo, who has a career 6.9 walk percentage and hits a homerun every 25.7 at bats. Castillo replaced Matt Wieters, who walks 8.1 percent of the time and hits a home run in every 27.8 at bats. Wieters and Markakis spent a combined 18 years in an Oriole uniform.\nJake Mintz has been following the Orioles closely in the Showalter era. Half of the popular Twitter account Cespedes Family BBQ, and most recently a Cut4 personality, Mintz says the team seems to be willing to live and die by the same player type.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going out and trying to develop hitters in that way, but it seems that the guys that they bring in kind of fit that mold,\u201d Mintz said. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re doubling down on that type of player.\u201d\nOne of the more recent Orioles success stories is Tim Beckham, whom the Orioles received from the Rays at the trade deadline this year. With the Orioles, he is hitting more home runs and walking less. And despite the lack of patience, Beckham\u2019s OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging percentage) with Baltimore is .270 points higher than it was with Tampa Bay.\n\nAlthough the Orioles have committed to this strategy, they\u2019ve still deviated from it \u2014 if an incoming player is talented enough.\nThe biggest example: Chris Davis, a cornerstone of the team since he arrived in 2011. Despite hitting a home run in every 15.4 at bats for his career, Davis also walks 10 percent of the time. When the team signed Davis to a 7-year, $161 million contract in 2016, they were looking at Davis\u2019 power output and less at his walk rate.\nEven when Davis doesn\u2019t walk, he takes notes from each plate appearance, something that his manager appreciates.\n\u201dI remember Chris, one time during the spring, had like an eight or nine pitch at bat,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cIn the dugout he was talking to me about \u201cI saw everything he has to offer in one at bat.\u2019\u201d",

    "summary": "Anthony Rendon, despite his elite-level play contributing to the Washington Nationals' second-best record in the National League, lacks significant MVP buzz and betting odds favoring him. However, his all-around excellence, reflected in leading WAR statistics, suggests he deserves more consideration in the MVP race.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland\u2013The Washington Nationals have the National League\u2019s second-best record. One of the main reasons: the elite-level play of third baseman Anthony Rendon.\nBut Rendon did not make the All-Star Team and, according to pundits and oddsmakers, does not have much chance of taking home the league\u2019s MVP award.\nSports betting website Bovada.com gives Rendon 20-1 odds to win the award \u2014 seventh-best in the league \u2014 compared to 3-2 odds for current favorite Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins.\nThe crowded league MVP race field also includes a handful of other Nationals\u2019 players. It feels like Rendon is \u201ccompeting against his own team to see who\u2019s really the most valuable player there,\u201d said MLB.com Nationals beat writer Jamal Collier.\n\u201cIn a race like this for the MVP, he\u2019s just a guy who a lot of people might not consider right away, until you really take a dive into his numbers and see how good he\u2019s been,\u201d Collier said. \u201cBut he definitely deserves to be in those first couple of names mentioned.\u201d\nHere are the top four reasons Rendon deserves to be in the MVP running.\n1. He\u2019s an all-around player\nRendon\u2019s statistical case for the award mostly rests on his all-around excellence. He\u2019s far above average at the plate, in the field and on the bases, pushing his total value higher than almost anyone else. While there are players better than Rendon at each of those three aspects of the game, very few have matched his performance in all three.\nWins Above Replacement (WAR) is an all-encompassing stat that measures how \u201cvaluable\u201d a player has been compared with a \u201creplacement player\u201d called up from the minor leagues.\nA leading baseball website, Fangraphs.com, has Rendon tied with the Houston Astros\u2019 Jose Altuve for the MLB position-player WAR lead at 6.5 wins. Odds-on MVP favorite Stanton comes in third at 6.1. Other WAR formulas find slightly different numbers, but most agree Rendon has been of the most valuable players in the league.\n\nRendon\u2019s all-around play this season should put him in the conversation for the MVP, said Andrew DiComo, a New York Mets beat writer for MLB.com.\n\u201cHe brings a lot of value, and I think he gets overshadowed by Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy,\u201d DiComo said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really, off the top of my head, have a weakness, and that\u2019s a pretty rare thing, especially in today\u2019s game when guys can be so specialized.\u201d\n2. He\u2019s a defensive stalwart\nOne factor that differentiates Rendon from most other league MVP candidates: a large part of his value lies in his defensive ability.\n\nHe plays an excellent hot corner, ranking among the league leaders in defensive metrics such as Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR). UZR assigns each play a run value and credits or penalizes a player depending on whether he made the play.\n\u201cDefensively he is as good as anybody else at that position,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWith Rendon, the impact he makes on the field, kind of how easily he picks it, watching it every day you get to really appreciate just how smooth he is defensively.\u201d\n\n3. He can hit, too\nRendon is not an elite power hitter like most of the other players in the MVP race, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from contributing as a hitter. Although not in the same rarefied air with the bat as he is on defense, he is still among the league\u2019s best hitters by several measures.\nHis on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) comes in at a stellar .948, a figure that ranks eighth in the league and 42 percent better than league average. That\u2019s ahead of Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado \u2014 a dark horse MVP candidate \u2014 although significantly behind Stanton. Using more traditional offensive stats, Rendon\u2019s 90 RBI are 10th in the league, ahead of slugging teammate Murphy.\n\nStill, a lack of power relative to his fellow MVP-chasers might hinder Rendon\u2019s candidacy in the end.\n\u201cHome runs is a sexy stat that people look at,\u201d DiComo said. \u201cWhat Giancarlo Stanton is doing right now [an MLB-best 53 home runs] for example has opened eyes. If you hit a lot of home runs, you\u2019re generally going to be in contention for postseason awards.\u201d\nRendon has hit 23 home runs this season, a personal career high. However, it still pales in comparison to Stanton and Arenado, who both have at least 30 homers.\n4. He\u2019s been consistent down the stretch\nThe MVP debate could change radically over the final weeks of the season. If Stanton leads the Marlins to an improbable playoff berth, or another candidate goes on a home-run binge, the narrative around the race is bound to shift.\nHenry Schulman, a Giants writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, has been part of the league MVP electorate each year since at least 2012. He places extra value on late-season performance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even start looking at numbers and such until the final week of the regular season because I am a big believer that September performance is important in the discussion,\u201d said Schulman via email. \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to tell you where I see Rendon fitting in.\u201d\nRendon\u2019s performance in recent weeks has done nothing to hurt his chances. Since Aug. 15, his OPS is a healthy .915 and his batting average is .333, significantly higher than his season mark of .304. In 20 games since mid-August, Rendon has knocked in 14 runs and collected 10 extra-base hits.\nDespite the possibility that a good September could put him in the conversation for the league\u2019s highest honor, Collier believes Rendon isn\u2019t focused on it.\n\u201cA lot of people will say when they\u2019re asked about it, \u2018Yeah I\u2019m not thinking about that I\u2019m focused on the team,\u2019\u201d Collier said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s not just lip service or BS when he says it because he generally shows up and plays the game and is kind of focused on baseball.\u201d",

Jamison Crowder, with an ADP of 65.2, offers flex/WR3 potential as a reliable target when Pryor and Reed are covered.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 What if you tried to assemble a fantasy football team made only out of players who played their home games in Maryland?\nDoing so might leave some glaring holes in your lineup, but there are nevertheless plenty of valuable fantasy players on Baltimore\u2019s and Washington\u2019s NFL rosters. Here are four players from each squad, along with their average draft position in ESPN fantasy leagues (as of Friday morning), what roles they should occupy on your fantasy team and why you should consider them.\n\u00a0\n1. Terrelle Pryor (WR, Washington)\nTerrelle Pryor appears in a game for the Cleveland Browns in 2016. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 32.9\nTarget as your: WR2\nWhy: Pryor wasn\u2019t even a wide receiver until last year, when he converted from quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. He eclipsed 1000 receiving yards* for a bad offense in 2016 and, through free agency, he joined Washington just as the team lost both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. He\u2019s widely considered the best wide receiver on the team now. Though not at the level of Antonio Brown or Odell Beckham Jr., Pryor is a great fit for your starting lineup.\n\u00a0\n2. Jordan Reed (TE, Washington)\nJordan Reed shouts during a game against the Green Bay Packers in 2016. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 45.4\nTarget as your: TE1\nWhy: Reed missed four games last year due to multiple injuries, but when he\u2019s on the field, he\u2019s one of the best tight ends in the business. In 2015, he had the second-most receptions among NFL tight ends (in just 14 games, no less). Over the last two seasons he caught 75.4 percent of passes thrown his way. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better tight end after Rob Gronkowski is off the board.\n\u00a0\n3. Jamison Crowder (WR, Washington)\nJamison Crowder plays in a 2016 game against the Green Bay Packers. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 65.2\nTarget as your: Flex/WR3\nWhy: Whenever opponents blanket Pryor and Reed in coverage this year, the 5-foot-9 Crowder should wiggle his way open. He had 67 catches and 99 targets last year while surrounded by Garcon, Jackson and Reed. He led the team with seven touchdown receptions, too. Washington throws the ball enough to keep giving Crowder a relatively high volume of targets. If he\u2019s on the board in the sixth round, consider him as a flex option.\n\u00a0\n4. Danny Woodhead (RB, Baltimore)\nDanny Woodhead carries the ball in a 2011 practice with the New England Patriots. Beth Hart/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 65.8\nTarget as your: Flex/bench option\nWhy: Woodhead\u2019s average draft position places him in the seventh round for 10-team leagues, but only target him that high if you play in a PPR (points per reception) league. Woodhead is expected to split carries with two other running backs, and last year the Ravens posted the NFL\u2019s third-fewest rushing attempts as a team (367). But in the last four seasons he played for the Chargers, Woodhead averaged 4.5 receptions a game and scored more touchdowns receiving (13) than rushing (five).\n\u00a0\n5. Kirk Cousins (QB, Washington)\nKirk Cousins plays in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2014. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 79.6\nTarget as your: QB1\nWhy: By now you\u2019ve read about the various receiving targets Washington has. Well, one guy is throwing to all of them. Cousins may be a polarizing figure, but ESPN analysts see him as the sixth-best fantasy quarterback this year. He approached the 5,000-yard mark in his fifth NFL season, finishing third in the league with 4,917. Another reason to be high on Cousins (at least statistically): His running back stable of Rob Kelley, Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson is among the least impressive in the league.\n\u00a0\n6. Mike Wallace (WR, Baltimore)\nMike Wallace (right) and Ryan Tannehill celebrate during a game the Miami Dolphins played in London in 2014. Airman 1st Class Trevor T. McBride/U.S. Air Force\nAverage draft position: 102.6\nTarget as your: Flex/bench option\nWhy: Wallace was targeted 116 times last year, and it\u2019s not ridiculous to think that number could go way up. The Ravens no longer have tight end Dennis Pitta (waived after injury) or wide receivers Steve Smith Sr. (retired) and Kamar Aiken (left in free agency). Even with Jeremy Maclin joining the receiving corps, Wallace stands out as great value late in your draft.\n\u00a0\n7. Justin Tucker (K, Baltimore)\nJustin Tucker warms up before a game in 2015. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 105.2\nTarget as your: Final draft pick\nWhy: Tucker\u2019s average draft position means people are selecting him long before the final round of their draft. You should never reach for a placekicker like that, but if Tucker is available for your last pick, he\u2019s a great option. No kicker in NFL history has a better career field goal conversion rate than Tucker (89.8 percent). And last year he reached double-digit fantasy points in nine of 16 games for the Ravens.\n\u00a0\n8. Joe Flacco (QB, Baltimore)\nJoe Flacco practices at Baltimore Ravens training camp in 2009. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 133.2\nTarget as your: QB2\nWhy: Flacco is not an elite quarterback, but he\u2019s a good backup in a pinch. An injury he sustained in training camp raised questions about his availability for opening weekend, according to RotoWire, which has lowered his draft stock. However, no quarterback dropped back to pass more often than Flacco in 2016 (672 pass attempts and 33 sacks, just higher than Drew Brees\u2019 673 attempts and 27 sacks). That amount of passing opportunities can translate into more opportunities for fantasy points.\n\u00a0\n*All statistics come from pro-football-reference.com.",

But during a five-set match in Flushing Meadows on Tuesday night, an unseeded 19-year-old from Maryland put up the kind of challenge Federer rarely faces in the early rounds of a Grand Slam event.\nFrances Tiafoe, the 70th-ranked tennis player in the world, won two sets against Federer in the opening round of the U.S. Open. Federer eventually beat Tiafoe, a native of Riverdale, Maryland, in five sets (4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 1-6, 6-4) but Tiafoe became the fourth player to take Federer to five sets \u2014 or defeat him \u2014 in the first two rounds of a Grand Slam since his first Grand Slam victory at Wimbledon in 2003, a Capital News Service analysis found.\n\nFederer, 36, won the 2017 Australian Open and Wimbledon, but his close call against Tiafoe came as he has dealt with knee and back injuries that caused him to miss three of the last six Grand Slams. According to ESPN, Federer said after the match he \u201calways knew (he) was going to come in feeling rusty or not great,\u201d but he also credited Tiafoe\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cGreat year so far. You\u2019re only getting better. Keep going, you\u2019re going to have one hell of a future.\u201d@rogerfederer to @FTiafoe #usopen pic.twitter.com/U0YOWjzJ8F\n\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) August 30, 2017\n\nIn an essay he wrote in The Players\u2019 Tribune this week, Tiafoe said he first faced Federer, a 19-time Grand Slam singles champion, in the 2017 Miami Open and lost to him in straight sets. Nevertheless, Tiafoe\u2019s star has been rising. He had a decorated junior career and trained at the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC) in College Park.\nRay Benton, the tennis center\u2019s CEO since 2008, has known the Tiafoe family for 15 years. Tiafoe\u2019s father, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, worked on building the academy and then became their head of maintenance, Benton said.\n\u201cFor the last five years, I\u2019ve thought that (Frances) would get to be one of the top 10 or 20 players in the world,\u201d Benton said. \u201cBut to see him at 19 playing Federer on center court on a Tuesday night match was almost surreal. It was such a big deal.\u201d\n\nCollege Park local @FTiafoe plays @rogerfederer tonight in the opening round of the @usopen! #goodluck Frances @TheJTCC (photo: art seitz) pic.twitter.com/U6NUhj6qnN\n\u2014 City of College Park (@CollegePark_MD) August 29, 2017\n\n\nA kid who started playing tennis at center where his dad was maintenance guy has Federer in a 5th in Ashe night match. I love tennis #USOpen\n\u2014 Nick McCarvel (@NickMcCarvel) August 30, 2017\n\nFederer\u2019s history of dominance in Grand Slams proves that Tiafoe\u2019s showing was, in fact, a big deal.\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Federer was still gaining his footing as a young phenom in the sport. He was shown the door in the first two rounds of a Grand Slam five times during that span and took five sets to win matches on three occasions.\nOnce he scored his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, the Swiss man grew to be one of the sport\u2019s most dominant forces, particularly in the U.S. Open. Federer won 66 straight first- and second-round U.S. Open sets between 2005 and 2015. His first-set loss to Tiafoe was the first time Federer dropped an early-round set since a 2004 second-round match against Marcos Baghdatis from Cyprus (a set Federer lost 7-6).\n\nSince then, early-round upsets and upset scares have been rare for Federer. He needed five sets to defeat Alejandro Falla of Colombia in the first round at Wimbledon in 2010, and again at the 2011 Australian Open against Frenchman Gilles Simon. Federer\u2019s only first- or second-round defeat in a Grand Slam since then came against Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, an unusual year where nine of the top 20 men and women lost in the first three days.\nAt 19, Tiafoe is far and away the youngest player to push Federer to five sets in an early Grand Slam round since 2003, the CNS analysis found.\nThe year 2003 in tennis stands out for another reason: It was the last time an American male player won a Grand Slam event. American fans might find hope in Tiafoe after he put up such a fight against Federer. As far as the future of American tennis, Benton says there are many male players on their way up.\n\u201cFrances is lucky because he has a group of American players his age who are all coming up, and so they\u2019re all pushing each other,\u201d Benton said, while noting that Tiafoe \u201cmay be the preeminent one.\u201d\nA rare early-round challenge to an all-time great certainly lends credence to that opinion.\n\nWhat fight from the Maryland native. Tiafoe leaves with plenty of new fans and won\u2019t be satisfied w simply going the distance w Fed #USOpen\n\u2014 Kelyn Soong (@KelynSoong) August 30, 2017",

It doesn\u2019t matter if your team scores 10 times if it gives up 11 runs, and your pitcher\u2019s one-run complete game doesn\u2019t help if his offense gets shut out.\nYou need to have some combination of hitting and pitching talent that allows you to come away with a positive run differential.\nRun differential was the single most predictive measure of success between 2007 and 2016, with a nearly perfect correlation of 0.95 to regular season win total that period. A correlation of 1.0 indicates a perfect relationship between two variables.\n\nLooking at each season by all 30 teams over 10 years, there is a correlation of 0.92 between run differential and regular season wins.\n\nA great regular season run differential does not guarantee playoff success, especially if a team goes cold in October. Over the last 10 years, there correlation between regular season run differential and postseason win total is smaller but still strong, 0.64.\nThe trend is obvious: the more runs a team scores than the opposition, the better the team\u2019s record.\nThat\u2019s how it averages out over time anyway. Crazy things can happen in a single year. The Texas Rangers secured home-field advantage last year with a 95-67 record, best in the American League. Their run differential was a meager +8, worst among all playoff teams. It also trailed the differential of four teams that missed the postseason.\nWith that differential, they would be expected to finish 82-80, according to Pythagorean Win-Loss, which Bill James developed to predict winning percentage based on runs scored and allowed. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the Rangers\u2019 true talent level, Texas lost all three games in its lone playoff series.\n2. Q: How should I try to beef up my run differential?\n A: Look to your position players to guide you\nGood hitting and pitching are necessary to record a positive run differential. But when deciding which one to spend on, it\u2019s important to remember that position players have had a greater influence on winning this decade.\nWins above replacement (WAR) judges a player\u2019s total contribution to the team based on the number of wins a player is worth compared to a minor-league call-up player. It measures a player\u2019s hitting, fielding, baserunning and pitching ability and makes comparisons to league and positional averages to find out how many wins a player is worth to his team.\nWorld Series winners and average teams receive a greater WAR contribution from their position players than pitchers. But while the difference between the regular season pitching by eventual title teams and the average squad is less than two wins above replacement (about 12 percent), the gap separating position players is huge.\nPosition players on championship teams are worth nearly 30 wins above replacement on average. An average group generates 19 WAR. That\u2019s a difference of 57 percent.\nWAR is a catch-all stat and it can be dangerous to use an all-inclusive number to judge talent. But the correlation between position player WAR and regular season win totals is 0.86 \u2014 and 0.64 for postseason win totals. WAR for pitchers has a correlation of 0.62 for regular season win totals. As far as all-inclusive stats go, WAR is pretty darn reliable, especially for position players.\n\n3. Q: Now that I\u2019ve chosen to build around position players, what kind of hitters should I employ?\n A: Hitters should control the strike zone\nIf you\u2019re still evaluating players based on the stats on the back of their baseball cards, you\u2019re falling behind in the MLB information race. But if you\u2019ve already bought the cards, the stat on the back you should be valuing most is on-base percentage.\nTeam on-base percentage has a 0.72 correlation to regular season wins and 0.54 to postseason win totals. This may come as a surprise, but walks were a better predictor of success than hits, extra base hits and home runs over the full 10 years. They were about equally important as extra base knocks and home runs on a yearly basis. Walks aren\u2019t flashy, but they put a man on first and help the team\u2019s chances of scoring a run at no cost.\n\nDrawing a walk requires a good sense of the strike zone. Hitters have to lay off pitches off the plate they likely can\u2019t touch. Some batters can\u2019t resist the urge to swing and can be manipulated into chasing pitches and striking out. Offensively, you want that to happen as little as possible.\nNothing positive comes with a strikeout. As long as the catcher keeps the ball in front of him, the batter heads back to the dugout and baserunners stay put. Teams that whiff a high percentage of the time find little success, as there is a -0.55 correlation between strikeout percentage and winning (as more batters strike out, wins fall).\nMaking contact with the pitch is the best way to avoid striking out. The 2015 Kansas City Royals have the highest contact percentage (81.9) and contact percentage on pitches in the zone (89.9) of the last five World Series winners. The pesky nature of their hitters helped make up for the team being fairly pedestrian in a number of offensive categories.\n4. Q: Is that all I need from my hitters? A knowledge of the strike zone and an ability to make contact?\n A: The offense should offer some power\nPower isn\u2019t the solution for every MLB team, but it\u2019s often a key component of the best teams to win the World Series. The average team hit 161 home runs per season this decade. The teams that won the title hit 170\u2014not a huge difference.\nBut among the World Series winners, more home runs led to more regular season wins, with a 0.59 correlation. That doubles the correlation between the two stats for the average team, meaning the juggernauts among the World Series winners were crushing the ball over the fence while the less successful title teams got by in other areas.\n\nThe two best teams of the last 12 years\u2014the 2016 Chicago Cubs and 2009 New York Yankees\u2014both won 103 games while slugging 199 and 244 home runs, respectively.\nIt\u2019s also hard to miss that the 2012 Giants managed just 103 home runs, 58 below league average and equivalent to 0.64 per game. But once the playoffs came along, they hit 14 round-trippers in 16 contests (0.875 per game).\nTeams that win the World Series usually spend the postseason out-homering the opposition. Title-winners hit nine percent more homers per game in the playoffs than the average postseason team. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but in the low-scoring October environment, it can be a difference-maker.\n5. Q: If I can\u2019t find players to hit the ball over the fence, can I win making speed my priority?\n A: Stolen base totals are not that important\nThe average team steals 95.5 bases a year. The number of wins associated with steals fluctuates greatly, making stolen base totals a downright unreliable indicator of success. Over the last decade, there has been a -0.07 correlation between stolen bases and wins, meaning there\u2019s little connection between the number of bags a team swipes and win total.\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nSome teams had a collection of gifted base stealers; the Philadelphia Phillies stole 136 in 2008 and the Boston Red Sox took 123 in 2013, for instance. However, three particularly slow-footed teams stole fewer than 60 bases in their regular seasons, which roughly translates to one stolen base every three games.\nFor further comparison, MIlwaukee Brewers infielder Jonathan Villar led the majors in 2016 with 62 steals.\nThe 2014 and 2010 San Francisco Giants and 2011 St. Louis Cardinals continued their glacial stolen base paces in the playoffs, maintaining their sub-0.4 stolen base per game rate. The 2015 Royals lead the decade\u2019s World Series winners with 14 stolen bases in 16 contests, 0.875 per game.\nAs a whole, sabermetrics suggest stolen bases are only helpful if teams can steal successfully at least 75 percent of the time. MLB teams from 2007 to 2016 stole safely 72.6 percent of the time and six of the 10 World Series winners eclipsed 75 percent. The 2013 Red Sox are the gold standard at 86.6 percent on 142 attempts.\n6. Q: Okay, so forget about base stealing. What if I trade some offensive ability for great defense?\n A: You can (and probably should) sacrifice defense to bolster the offense\nDefense has always been the most difficult aspect of baseball to track and evaluate. The sport is better at judging a catcher\u2019s ability to steal strikes with his pitch-framing than it is at understanding who its best defensive players are (former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter has five Gold Gloves despite his limited fielding range, for instance).\nSo it should come as little surprise that the defensive analytics are not nearly as predictive of success as offensive and pitching statistics. Defensive Runs Saved and Ultimate Zone Rating, which assign run values to judge a player\u2019s defense against the average, are the most reliable. Their correlations to regular season and playoff winning hover around 0.40.\n\nFollow sports long enough and you\u2019ll surely run into the \u201cdefense wins championships\u201d adage. That phrase is not set in stone when it comes to baseball. Four of the last 10 World Series winners were below average in regular season Defensive Runs Saved, with negative marks indicating the defenses hurt the team more than they helped.\nAlthough the numbers have not yet reflected a direct link between good fielding and winning, the 2016 Cubs served as an example of what help a strong defense can be. The Cubs saved the second-most defensive runs of the decade (82), trailing only the 2013 Royals (95).\nOn a related note, Chicago had the fourth-lowest ERA of the last 10 years (3.15). Fielding independent pitching, which is like ERA but takes a pitcher\u2019s supporting fielders out of the equation, suggests Chicago\u2019s staff had the talent worthy of a 3.77 ERA. No team had a better difference between ERA and FIP over the last decade than the 2016 Cubs.\n\nPaired with their outstanding offense, the Cubs recorded an astronomical run differential of +252. That was the most since the Seattle Mariners outscored opponents by 300 runs in 2001. That Seattle squad tied the all-time record by winning 116 games.\nIf you don\u2019t buy into defensive sabermetrics, the simplest of defensive stats gets the point across. Errors do not matter as long as they don\u2019t create unearned runs. There\u2019s a -0.30 correlation between errors and regular season wins, and a near-zero correlation between errors and World Series titles. Meanwhile, unearned runs have a -0.40 correlation with regular season wins and a -0.49 correlation with World Series titles.\nTranslation: Even playoff teams make mistakes in the field. The best ones make sure they don\u2019t happen when runners on base could score.\n7. Q: Speaking of preventing runs, how do I best manage my pitchers?\n A: Keep your starting pitchers in the game as long as you can in the regular season\nWe were bound to run into this debate after the Cleveland Indians bullpen tore up the postseason and propelled them to within a game of winning the World Series. But the truth remains that relievers should be used sparingly in the regular season.\nInnings pitched per game by starters has a correlation of 0.48 with regular season wins, while daily reliever innings is correlated -0.45 with wins. Relievers get burned out when they are overused and they start giving up more runs.\nRelievers are extremely important in the postseason. The ability by the bullpen to strand base runners on base without scoring is better correlated with World Series titles (0.46) than regular season wins (0.40).\nThe closer holds even more influence on the playoffs. Ex-Yankees closer Mariano Rivera holds the all-time regular season saves record, but he earned his aura of invincibility in the playoffs, where he saved 42 games and had a 0.70 ERA.\nNot many possess Rivera\u2019s ability to finish off postseason wins; save percentage is one of the biggest statistical gaps between the team winning the World Series and an average playoff squad. Championship teams convert their save chances 83 percent more often.\n\n8. Q: I picked up a reliable closer. What do I need to build a lead for him to save in a playoff game?\n A: It\u2019s really difficult to hit in the playoffs\nIt\u2019s extremely hard for batters to find success at any time of the year, given how hard it is to connect with a fastball running in at 95+ mph. The degree of difficulty only increases in October, when temperature drops shorten the distance of batted balls and the sport\u2019s best arms are always on the mound.\nBased on postseason run prevention and batting average allowed, playing the team that goes on to win the championship is roughly equivalent to taking an at-bat against Red Sox righty Rick Porcello every time up at the plate. Porcello won the 2016 AL Cy Young.\n\nFacing any random playoff team is akin to stepping in to face Giants lefty Matt Moore. Moore has never put a season quite as good as Porcello\u2019s 2016 together, but he is capable of having amazing games. He came within an out of no-hitting the Los Angeles Dodgers last August and tormented the Cubs for eight innings of one-run ball in Game 4 last October before Chicago stormed back in the ninth to win the series.\n\nEven against pitchers averaging the stats put up by Moore, postseason teams really struggle to find hits. A normal playoff offense is about as productive as the 2011 Mariners, who finished last in the AL in most offensive categories and at one point lost 17 games in a row.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, the average bats of the World Series winner are on par with last year\u2019s Pittsburgh Pirates, a fairly ordinary offensive team.\n\nOffense dries up in the playoffs and baserunners are hard to come by. Driving in runs often requires a big, timely extra-base hit. The World Series-winning team gets 22 percent more extra-base hits (3.0 to 2.4) and 39 percent more RBIs (4.6 to 3.3) per playoff game. Those differences go a long way toward winning in October.\n9. Q: With all those roster areas to pay attention to, how expensive is this team going to be?\n A: Building a good team will likely cost a chunk of money\nBaseball is the only one of the top four North American sports that doesn\u2019t use a salary cap. Teams have more statistical information now than they used to and top-market teams like the Yankees can\u2019t run away with the league by outspending everyone anymore. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work, in theory.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, eight of the 10 teams that spent the most were above .500. Six of the 10 clubs that spent the fewest finished below .500. The free-spending Dodgers and Yankees, the league\u2019s top-two check writers, had the third- and fourth-most wins in baseball.\nOver those six seasons, there was a correlation of 0.547 between total money spent and regular season win totals.\nSome teams remained competitive despite their small markets and payrolls. The Indians, Pirates, Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays all finished above .500 over the course of those six years despite doling out $520 million or less.\n10. Q: How did those small market teams win? Is there a market inefficiency?\n A: Spending on pitchers helps, but you don\u2019t have to if you draft and develop pitching well.\nPitching offered an interesting spectrum of results. The Dodgers and Giants spent the most on their arms. San Francisco won two of its championships after 2011, while Los Angeles won the third-most games in the league. Meanwhile, the Cubs and Phillies paid heavily for pitching and finished below .500. The two teams entered a rebuilding phase that saw them on the hook for big contracts for players they traded to restock the farm system.\n\nAs Chicago and Philadelphia floundered, a handful of small-market clubs flourished. The Pirates, Athletics, Rays, Indians and Atlanta Braves all finished above .500, not a club among them spending more than $200 million on pitching. All five teams leaned heavily on young pitchers on entry-level contracts.\nA team like the Rays cannot afford the salary an ace like lefty David Price would command in free agency. Tampa Bay hung onto Price as long as it could, then traded him in his last summer under contract. That way, the Rays could at least get some prospects in return for Price before he could sign with another team, which would leave Tampa Bay with nothing.\nPrice won the AL Cy Young in 2012 with a $4.35 million tagline and finished second in 2010 while making $1 million, according to Spotrac. Indians ace Corey Kluber won the award in 2014 while earning $514,000. The pitching rotations of these teams have been littered with pitchers too young to command big dollars, and those approaching pay days are quickly shipped off for the next crop of prospects.\n_____\nStill feeling confident you can build a team destined for greatness?\nWe\u2019ve seen there are a ton of variables to keep track of and resources can be limited. Everyone is looking for the winning mix, and now I\u2019ve spilled some of the secret ingredients to the world. This recipe won\u2019t be perfect\u2014few things in baseball are\u2014but follow the directions and you should find your team hanging around the playoff picture. May luck be in your favor from that point on.",

    "summary": "The excitement of an NBA postseason varies among fans and can be quantified by \"the excitement index,\" which measures the fluctuation in win probability during games; using this metric, the Cleveland-Indiana matchup was predicted to be the most thrilling due to the LeBron James vs. Paul George rivalry.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2013 Whether you are a fan of the NBA or a network executive looking to attract as many viewers to TV screens as possible, your hopes for the postseason are the same: an exciting outcome.\nOf course, the word \u201cexciting\u201d is subjective. To some, an exciting postseason would lead to a rematch between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight year \u2014 and LeBron James\u2019 seventh consecutive finals appearance. To others, an exciting postseason would be filled with upsets galore.\nIn order to create a consistent definition, Mike Beuoy, creator of the sports data visualization blog inpredictable.com, quantified the term by creating \u201cthe excitement index.\u201d\nThe number is derived from win probability graphs, an example of one from Beuoy\u2019s site is shown below.\n\nThe line is a live probability tracker, which measures each team\u2019s chance of winning over the span of a game, accounting for the score and remaining time. The excitement index measures the total distance the line travels as it moves up and down throughout the game. \nWe used the excitement index to attempt to predict which first-round playoff matches would offer the most back-and-forth play.  We started with the Cleveland and Indiana Pacers first-round matchup, examining the average excitement index from the four times those teams played during the regular season.  We used the same method the rest of the teams.\n\n\nThe most exciting matchup \u2014 Cleveland-Indiana \u2014 was a continuation of the LeBron James vs. Paul George rivalry that hasn\u2019t seen the postseason since 2014. In the conventional sense of excitement, there aren\u2019t many surprises here. \nHouston Rockets \u2013 Oklahoma City Thunder was a battle between the two leading MVP candidates. While it was fun to watch Steph Curry cook his way through Portland\u2019s defense, it did not yield a fun back-and-forth battle between the teams.\nIt\u2019s commonly believed that once the playoffs start, the regular season no longer matters. If you want proof, look at how many Presidents\u2019 Trophies (for best regular season record)  the Washington Capitals have (3), and compare that to their number of Stanley Cups (0).\nOur playoff excitement prediction did not hold up too well to reality. The graphic below compares our first-round series prediction (based on the regular season) with the actual average excitement index (based on the postseason so far). \n\n\nFour of the eight first-round series averaged higher excitement indexes than they did in the regular season and some series even experienced some significant index jumps (see L.A. Clippers-Utah Jazz series). These numbers become more impactful when compared to last year\u2019s postseason.\nIn 2016, the first-round excitement predictions were similar to this season\u2019s. Though the range of the indexes may be smaller, the averages of each year\u2019s first-round matchups come out to roughly the same, about 6.08.\n\n\nThe similarities stopped there. Overall, viewers of the NBA playoffs saw a first round that was less exciting than the regular season.\n\n\nOf the eight first-round matchups, only two \u2014 Cleveland-Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs -Memphis Grizzlies \u2014 averaged slightly higher indexes in the playoffs than in the regular season. As a whole, the excitement average dropped from 6.089 in the regular season to 5.364 in the playoffs.\nThe lazy argument: this makes sense because fans already know who is going to make the finals and the players let those storylines get to them and affect their play. Thankfully, this year\u2019s playoffs dispel that point.\nThis season, the playoff excitement index was higher than the regular season excitement index. Yes, it was only a .053 increase (from 6.075 to 6.128), but it\u2019s a .86 increase from the year before. Only one series, Golden State-Portland, had a lower average index than last season\u2019s playoff average. Five series fell into that category in 2016.\nIt\u2019s difficult to point to one explanation. It could be that teams in both conferences got better, particularly in the East where wins were distributed more evenly. Whatever the case, one thing is certain: the playoffs these year are definitely worth the watch.",

As part of ticket sales promotions, the Orioles let children younger than 14 run the bases after every Sunday home game. (Hannah Klarner / Capital News Service)\n\u201cIt think (it was successful),\u201d Larry Nace said. \u201cThe line\u2019s enormous.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be nice to see more events like (this),\u201d Mary added.\nP.K. Kannan, a professor of marketing science at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, said ticket promotions are an example of a commonplace marketing strategy by businesses.\nThe idea behind ticket promotions is that teams must spend money \u2014 an acquisition cost \u2014 in order to draw in fans. This practice gives fans an incentive to enter into a relationship with a team, Kannan said.\nThe goal of the practice is to convert these new attendees into regulars, he added.\nAn example of this practice would be promotion pricing for new customers, offered by companies such as Uber.\n\u201cNot everyone will come back, but maybe a percentage will become regulars,\u201d Kannan said.\nOn the other hand, fans say that promotions are not always the only reason they go to games \u2014 but they do have some impact. \nJenn Buckley and Spencer Cooper \u2014 two fans at the Orioles-Red Sox game \u2014 said that while promotions would not be the only reason they went, if there were multiple games and only one had a promotion they would \u201cabsolutely\u201d go to that one.\nAt the game, Cooper wore Buckley\u2019s Orioles Hawaiian shirt \u2014 a popular promotional item from a few seasons ago. \n\u201c(I) went for the shirt, (but it was) also the O\u2019s-(Nationals) game,\u201d Buckley said.\nThe game was one of two with a promotion during the three-game weekend series in July 2015. Both games with promotions saw nearly 2,000 more people attend than those without. \nOver the past three seasons, weekend games \u2014 meaning Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2014 with promotions had, on average, between 1,500 and 5,000 more people in attendance than those without.\n\nA 2012 article analyzing attendance for the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 2010 season in the Sports Business Journal by Wayne DeSarbo, a marketing professor at Penn State University, found that while promotions are not guaranteed to cause above-average attendance, every game with above-average attendance had a promotion.\nThe promotions that had the highest impact on attendance included those with specific giveaways \u2014 such as a bobblehead \u2014 or games with a concert or fireworks afterward, DeSarbo wrote.\nPromotions are never the only factor in who attends a game. Other factors include weather, team performance and the opponent, DeSarbo said.\nAccording to DeSarbo, a key factor in the need for promotions is the specific team\u2019s success rate. Team\u2019s are likely to need more promotions when they are unlikely to compete for a World Series, he said.\n\u201c(They) get people to attend for other reasons beyond seeing the home team win,\u201d DeSarbo told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \nWhen teams are less competitive, it becomes \u201ca matter of family entertainment,\u201d he added. \n\u201cWhere you don\u2019t see the need for such expense is when you have a shot of going all the way,\u201d DeSarbo said. \nTeams also look to diversify the types of promotions they offer. \nCraig Gentry, at home plate, prepares for an at-bat during the Baltimore Orioles home game against the Boston Red Sox on April 23, 2017, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles reported that 35,522 fans attended the game. Some came as part of the ticket promotion Kids Run The Bases, which allows children younger than 14 to run the bases following Sunday home games. (Hannah Klarner / Capital News Service)\n\u201cWhen planning a promotional calendar, we are always looking to appeal to a diverse fan base,\u201d Greg Bader, Orioles vice president for communications and marketing, said in a statement through a team spokeswoman. \u201cSundays are designed to be a \u2018family fun day\u2019 at the ballpark. Kids Run the Bases after every Sunday game and we direct some of our \u2018kids only\u2019 promotions to those games.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen planning a promotional calendar, we are always looking to appeal to a diverse fan base,\u201d Greg Bader, Orioles vice president for communications and marketing, said in a statement through a team spokeswoman. \u201cSundays are designed to be a \u2018family fun day\u2019 at the ballpark.

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 The Washington Wizards just won their division for the first time in nearly 40 years, and the biggest driver of their success has been franchise superstar John Wall.\nThe four-time all star is putting up career highs in points and assists and leading the league in steals. But he\u2019s unlikely to get any votes for MVP because of historic seasons from Russell Westbrook and James Harden, both of whom are posting league-leading stat lines.\n\n\nWestbrook, of the Oklahoma City Thunder, is the first player in 55 years to average a triple-double for the season (30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, 11.4 assists). And the Houston Rockets\u2019 Harden, under a new coach and in a new position, is somehow leading the league in assists and win shares.\nJohn Wall is playing out of his mind. His problem: he\u2019s doing it in the wrong year. A Capital News Service analysis found he\u2019d have a strong case for getting at least one MVP vote \u2014 and maybe even winning the award \u2014 in at least three of the last 15 seasons.\nWe compared Wall\u2019s 2017 statistical output to guards who received at least a single MVP vote in prior seasons, to see how Wall would have fared. We didn\u2019t compare him to centers or forwards, who tend to have different statistical profiles.\nWe think he would have gotten at least one vote in 2006-2007. He would have been in the running in 2004-2005. And he probably could have won in 2001-2002.\n2006-2007\nIt\u2019s clear that Wall could not have won the MVP this season. Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki \u2014 perhaps the greatest European player in NBA history \u2014 won on the back of a career year.\nThe player who finished second, Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash, did better than Wall in most statistical categories, and had a breakout season with their famous \u201cseven seconds or less\u201d offense, winning 61 games.\nBut 2017 John Wall almost certainly would have received one vote. His stat line in this season compares favorably to Nash in terms of steals and points. And he surpassed Tony Parker, the guard who received the lowest number of MVP votes that season, in all but one category.\n\n\nAnother point in his favor: the point guards who got MVP votes that season averaged 20.5 points, 7.7 assists, 3.8 rebounds and a 22.3 player efficiency rating. Wall beats out all of those numbers.\n2004-2005\nIn this season, Wall has a stronger case for winning the award. Nash, the 2005 MVP, had a down year statistically compared to 2007.\nWall leads Nash and Washington Wizards Gilbert Arenas, the guard with the least MVP votes this season, in every single category, except win shares. The win-share deficit can be explained by the fact that Wall\u2019s 2017 teammates are simply better than Nash\u2019s or Arenas\u2019 were in 2005.\nAnd while Nash anchored the league\u2019s highest scoring offense that year, the 2017 Wizards would have been the second highest-scoring offense in 2005, averaging about one point less per game.\n\n\nExcept for assists, Arenas put up better numbers than Nash. But the 2005 Wizards only won 41 games, compared to 61 for Nash\u2019s Suns. Since 1981, no MVP has come from a team with less than 50 wins. The Wizards won 49 games this year.\nThe win totals makes it difficult to definitively say that Wall would have beaten out Nash for the MVP, but we can assume that he would have had a fighting chance.\n2001-2002\nWe think Wall would have won this year. Point guard Jason Kidd, of the New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, almost beat San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan in the race for MVP, narrowly finishing second. Other than rebounding, Wall beats out Kidd in every statistical category. And the Wizards only finished four games behind the Nets regular season record.\nYes, the New Jersey Nets winning 26 more games than the previous season fueled Kidd\u2019s MVP candidacy. But Kidd ended up with the same number of win shares as Wall while playing more games and more minutes, meaning it took him longer to produce the same number of wins for his team. And he was way better than the guard with the lowest number of votes, Mike Bibby of the Sacramento Kings.\n\n\nThis year\nWhat about this year? Should the fact that Wall brought the franchise to a level it has not seen in decades earn him MVP votes? We say yes.\nThe good news for Wall: the playoffs start Saturday, showcasing the Eastern Conference\u2019s best point guard to a national audience. The bad news for Wall: the votes for MVP have already been cast.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 As a 1 seed, North Carolina had the weight of high expectations entering the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament. In winning their sixth national title Monday, the Tar Heels did even better than 1 seeds typically do.\nIn fact, over the last three decades, North Carolina has outplayed their seed more consistently than all but one team, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nTop seeded teams win just over three games on average in the tournament, which requires six victories to win (excluding the play-in games), as this graphic shows.\n\nSince 1985, North Carolina\u2019s seeding predicts the team should have won 71.73 games in the tournament. They\u2019ve actually won 88 games, or 16.27 more than expected. The only team with a better record of exceeding expectations: Kentucky, with 16.85 extra wins.\n\nWhile Duke has more wins during that period than any other team \u2013 90 \u2013 they were also expected to win more games than everyone else.\nFor schools with at least 15 tournament appearances, Pittsburgh was the worst. The team had more wins than their seed predicted in only four out of 19 tournaments.\nWhat about coaches? Some coaches, like Michigan State\u2019s Tom Izzo, have mastered the art of exceeding expectations.\nIzzo has won 14.42 more games than his seeds predicted, highest amongst coaches with at least 10 tournament appearances.\nDuke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski has the most wins of any coach in the tournament with 90, but ranks seventh when it comes to meeting expectations.\n\nGonzaga\u2019s Mark Few, who coached the losing team Monday night, has done about as well as expected; he\u2019s won 1.45 more games than his seeds predicted.\nAt the other end, former Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson was more than 10 games under his expected wins. His teams did better than their seed in just over a third of their appearances.",
