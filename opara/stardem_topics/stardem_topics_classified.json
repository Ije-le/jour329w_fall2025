Onlookers will even have the chance to meet and get a selfie with Oscar the Osprey, enjoy live music and move through nature activity stations.\nAlthough the event will take place at Drum Point Park, there is limited parking in the neighborhood and those planning to attend should park at Patuxent High School in Lusby and take the courtesy shuttle to the park.\nAdmission is $10 per single individual attendees or $20 for an entire family. Also, guests should keep in mind that there are absolutely no pets allowed on site, with the exception being for service animals.\n\"One thing that people should realize is that the osprey is not only an amazing bird, but also vital to the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding ecological system,\" said Sal Icaza, the driving force behind the outset of the Maryland Osprey Nature Festival in 2022. \"Each winter they basically migrate to South America, but they always return right around St. Patrick's Day and they are truly amazing to watch any time of day.\"\nIcaza noted that ospreys derive \"99%\" of their diet from fish and they can be seen diving toward the surface of the water for a catch from morning to sunset.\nFellow organizer Rick Smith commended Icaza for his work organizing the annual event and admitted that he also has a genuine bird's eye view of the ospreys from his home. He said the birds never cease to amaze him.\n\"Each year once the ospreys return from their migration south to the Chesapeake Bay they truly are exceptional birds to behold,\" said Smith, who noted the ospreys have rebounded from declining numbers in the 1970s after pesticides were reduced.\n\"They are able to dive into the water at perhaps 40 miles per hour and dive well below the surface to catch fish,\" he said. \"They rarely come up without something in their talons. Whereas bald eagles dive down and basically skim the surface of the top of the water for their catch, ospreys can dive well below the surface and come away with a fish.\"\nIf you go\nThe third annual Maryland Osprey Nature Festival will be held at Drum Point Park on Saturday, April 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Parking for the event is scheduled for Patuxent High School, located at 12485 Southern Connector Boulevard in Lusby, with a courtesy shuttle provided. Entry fee for the event is $10 per person or $20 per family.\nIf you love birds, wildlife and nature, or just want to learn more, come out and be part of this festival for a great cause.\nFor more information about the festival, visit https://marylandospreyfestival.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — This was setting up like so many other past unhappy endings for North Dorchester High's boys basketball team.The Eagles had held the lead for the bulk of the first half, only to falter when the opposition rallied to take the lead after halftime.\nSt. Michaels was pretty much following that script Monday night, erasing a first-half deficit on the way to building a modest six-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. But North Dorchester pieced together a comeback of its own, outscoring the Saints 15-6 in the final period for a 50-49 victory that ended its three-game slide.\n\"We're lucky to get out of here with a win,\" said Eagles head coach Robert Smith Jr., his team now 2-3 overall, 1-3 North Bayside. \"There was a time where we would of settled in and been like, 'Oh, this is over.' But they didn't stop fighting. They never quit, and good things will come if they keep playing like that.\"\nSt. Michaels (2-4, 2-3) — which dressed only seven players after eight were suspended for leaving the bench during an altercation with Kent County on Dec. 19 — trailed 15-9 after the first quarter, then outscored North Dorchester, 34-22, over the next two quarters to carry a 43-37 lead into the fourth.\nBut the Saints went cold from the floor over the final 8 minutes while the Eagles steadily chipped away at their deficit.\nVictor Merrit began the rally when he made one of two free-throw attempts, then scored on a layup, drawing the visitors within three. Tahjere Pritchett (eight points) tied the game at 43-all with 5 minutes, 46 seconds remaining. North Dorchester, which converted just 7 of 24 attempts from the foul line, had chance to take the lead less than 30 seconds later, but Merrit missed a pair of free throws.\nSt. Michaels regained the lead at 45-43, when Johnny Mautz (game-high 20 points) scored on a drive with 5:09 remaining.\nThe Eagles answered, with Jazeon Cephas hitting a jumper with 4:30 to go, and Pritchett scoring a layup 20 seconds later for a 47-45 lead.\nBoth teams missed a pair of foul shots before North Dorchester's Alvin Hutton (team-high 18 points) made the second of two attempts with 2:49 left, nudging the Eagles' lead to 48-45.\nMautz scored on a follow 14 seconds later, was fouled, but couldn't complete the three-point play. Hutton, who buried five first-half 3-pointers, grabbed the ball and raced coast to coast for a layup before getting fouled. Hutton missed the free throw, but had provided what proved to be the game-winning bucket with 2:25 remaining for a 50-47 Eagles lead.\n\"Nothing is easy in the Bayside,\" Smith said. \"It was one of them games where it could have gone either way. We were back and forth, back and forth. But I give our guys credit because they fought.\"\nThe drama wasn't quite over though.\nMautz made a left-handed shot with 1:35 remaining to pull St. Michaels within 50-49. Pritchett was fouled on a 3-point attempt, but could not lengthen North Dorchester's lead from the foul line\nSt. Michaels had chances over the final minute, with Connor Wheeler (eight points) watching a shot spin around and off the rim, and Mautz missing on a pair of putback attempts.\n\"It came down to a couple of possessions late in the game going back and forth,\" Saints head coach Kentrell \"Boo\" Ricketts said. \"I thought we got a real good look at the basket at the end when we were down one. It just happened to not go in.\n\"We missed a lot of shots that usually go down for us,\" Ricketts added. \"Some times I think we were taking quick shots and forcing the issue. I keep telling my guys, 'Some times we're beating ourselves. It's not necessarily these teams beating us.' But hat's off to North Dorchester for finishing out. They hit a lot of key shots. They had the one kid (Hutton who) shot the ball very well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Birding and boating the Harriet Tubman Byway\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — On Thursday afternoon, a tour group traversed the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Scenic Byway while also spotting 25 species of birds.The event, \"Birding & Boating the Harriet Tubman Byway,\" was hosted by Alex Green and Jim Rapp. It aimed at highlighting Tubman's accomplishments while also celebrating the nature of the Eastern Shore.\nJeanea Blair came all the way from Baltimore for the excursion.\n\"I love that we can combine history and nature, which I think traditionally people don't combine those things. It shows you can't really separate one from the other. The land informs our history and the history informs our land. It is cool to see that intersection and learn more about all of our history,\" Blair said.\nThe tour featured several sites that are central to the life and work Harriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who escaped from slavery in Dorchester County and became well-known for her work on the Underground Railroad.\nGreen, owner of Harriet Tubman Tours, gave context to each site.\nRapp, owner of Delmarva Birding Weekends, was the second guide. He had a pair of binoculars around his neck and was listening for chirps, watching attentively for birds.\n\"Alex is interpreting the reason why Linchester Mill, The Webb Cabin and the Caroline County Courthouse has so much importance to the Underground Railroad. Then on the boat we are still interpreting both things, but I step up and do the birding portion. We sort of tag team. This tour is about Harriet Tubman's work on the Underground Railroad,\" Rapp said.\nMany sites were visited by the caravan of cars who followed the guides. Several participants said they had driven by the Underground Railroad signs on the road, but had never stopped.\nThe Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Scenic Byway is a self-guided driving tour through Caroline and Dorchester Counties, with significant sites marked with signage. It continues north to Philadelphia.\nOne stop was the Leverton House, which was owned by Quakers Jacob and Hannah Leverton, supporters of the Underground Railroad. It was a dairy farm at the time. Although the Levertons were wealthy, hiding and clothing those escaping slavery was a risky undertaking. Now the private home has a long dusty road with corn fields all around, turkey vultures flying overhead.\nRapp said most birds can't smell a thing.\n\"Vultures have a huge nasal opening and a lot of senses in there. They are sniffing for stinky, rotten stuff,\" Rapp said.\nThere was sturdy but small cabin in Preston, which was owned by James Webb. The tour went inside and got to see the \"potato hole,\" a trap door beneath the house, under which Webb would hide people escaping on the Underground Railroad.\n\"This is where James Webb worked his farm and lived and worked the Underground Railroad. He was a farmer and an Underground Railroad agent,\" Green said.\nStanding in front of the Caroline County Courthouse, where slaves were sold, Green said the land affected the slave trade. The current courthouse replaced one that burned down.\n\"The menacing building of the time with slave auctions would be somewhat of a fanfare. It is just like going to a car auction. This is where they sold African Americans. A lot of commerce comes up and down the river. From here you can go anywhere you need to go in the world by the Choptank River all the way to the Atlantic,\" Green said.\nThere was a former school teacher of history on the tour. She wrote her senior thesis on abolitionists.\n\"It is great. I am learning things that I didn't know before and supplanting things I already knew,\" Betty McAdams said.\nWhen Rapp saw a handful of hummingbirds, they filled the air with a buzzing sound.\nHe said, \"Our predominant hummingbird on the East Coast is the ruby throat. Males have a bright, shiny metallic-looking throat.\"\nThe history buffs turned into avid naturalists as the tiny birds flitted around orange jewel weed blossoms. Later in the tour the saw a red tailed hawk.\nAt the end, the group boarded a 33-foot tritoon named Ellen B. The captain, Allan Thomason, had his daughter Ali Thomason as first mate.\nThough birding and Underground Railroad history are a unique pairing, Green and Rapp bring life to both subjects.\nIn the winter they come together to do a different tour in Dorchester County that focuses on Tubman's early life. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Over 200 people came to the sold out 7 a.m. annual prayer breakfast held at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department. On Thursday amens from the dressed-up crowd reached to the rafters.Sheriff Joe Gamble was the master of ceremonies who introduced the 13 speakers at the event. They focused on their faith and how their life stories shaped their relationship with God. Some were pastors and reverends. Some were politicians, educators and business leaders. Many hugs were given and hands were held high in reverence. Biblical passages from protective wings to deadly pestilence were read.\nGamble said, \"We are really excited with a sellout crowd, and we have got some great speakers today. We have 230 or 240 people. We can't thank the Volunteer Fire Company enough. They donated the space today.\"\nPrayers were directed to leaders of the town. There were prayers for first responders, educators and the nation at large. There was a special acknowledgement to Paul Carroll who has kept the 41-year tradition of the prayer breakfast alive. He serves on a committee that keeps the prayer breakfast going.\n\"We realize the importance of prayer and we need to continue this,\" Carroll said. \"It is a different venue, but we are happy to have it. After the food, we have two speakers Jimmy Rogers and Wendy Palmer.\"\nRogers told how he died and came back to life convinced in his faith. He served in Vietnam as a Marine and then joined the Easton Police Department. Although he had to read his remarks because of a traumatic brain injury, he held the audience's attention.\n\"I would like to share with you the story of God's incredible works in my life,\" Rogers said. \"It includes miracles, forgiveness, incredible acts of healing, redemption and saving a person totally unworthy of such acts.\"\nHe had a heart attack and died in his bathroom. His wife found him.\n\"She found me on the floor, not breathing and no pulse. She called 911 and started CPR. This was not a near-death experience. It meets all the clinical criteria for death,\" Rogers said.\nWhen the EMTs arrived, they shocked him multiple times and tried to revive him for 20 minutes. One last effort induced a weak pulse. They rushed him to the hospital.\n\"I had a 98% blockage in the coronary artery known as the widow maker,\" he said.\nIn that death experience, he had a vision of a friend who had died two years earlier.\n\"I was walking through the woods. The sun shining more than you can possibly imagine. The leaves had incredible colors. The air was crisp and clear, and I came to a stream of crystal clear water cascading over the rocks. It was absolutely heavenly, and I have never felt such peace. I never wanted to leave this place,\" Rogers said.\nHe saw his friend on the other side of the river. The friend told Rogers to go back. Then Rogers awoke from his coma. He wonders if it was a glimpse of the after life or just a drug-induced dream. As Rogers told his story, the room was silent, the crowd engrossed in his testimony.\nThe second testimony came from Wendy Palmer, director of chronic diease and prevention programs at the YMCA of the Chesapeake. She spoke of service both in her role as a 31-year restauranteur and now helping people to get moving at the Y.\n\"It is never to late. At 57 on December the 19th, I was born again. I was baptized,\" Palmer said.\nShe says she is in her infancy of faith but is a lifelong learner.\n\"I get to help people move and feel good and be in community. And I tell our staff and our team at the Y that everybody comes to our Y — the front porch of the community as Robbie Gill refers to the Y — to be seen, to be heard and to be loved,\" Palmer said.\n\"If we can do that everyday in a way that magnifies our Lord, He will be so proud of us and our work.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What is it?The declarer enjoys a considerable advantage during the card-play. To try to balance the books (as my librarian phrases it), a defender makes the opening lead. Sometimes this is critical -- as in today's deal.\nNote that if the declarer plays first in four spades, he can draw trumps immediately, aided by the 2-2 split. Then he cashes his two top hearts and ruffs a heart in the dummy, bringing down West's queen. South graciously concedes three tricks.\nHowever, West made the opening lead tell. He selected the diamond two, which East won with the queen. As West had supported diamonds, East wasn't tempted to try to cash the diamond ace. Even if West had made an eccentric raise on three low diamonds, he would have led his highest diamond, not the two.\nEast switched to the club ace and continued with the club 10. After winning with the king, West saw what was needed to defeat the contract. He led another club, and East didn't let her partner down. She ruffed with the spade queen.\nSouth overruffed with the spade king, but now West had to win a trump trick. The uppercut had been decisively delivered.\nVoltaire said that marriage is the only adventure open to the cowardly.

    "content": "'Still matters today': Community to read famous Frederick Douglass speech on Saturday\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass asked a burning question in front of hundreds of abolitionists in Rochester, New York: \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\"The Talbot County native, often considered the most important abolitionist and civil rights leader of his time, delivered an address that described why enslaved African Americans weren't afforded the same freedoms and liberties that could allow them to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence like the rest of the nation.\nDouglass' famous speech is still popular 173 years later. On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people — in age, race, occupation and more — participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "St. Michaels talks tax rates at commissioners meeting\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 848\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - At a meeting Wednesday, the Commissioners of St. Michaels spoke about gathering stakeholders to discuss the town's tax rates.The discussion followed an issues brief sent to the commissioners from the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association.The issues brief argues that St. Michaels, \"a small tourist town with a tourism economy,\" is largely supported by its residents, rather than its businesses.\"The infrastructure needed to support Talbot County's and the town's tourism economy imposes a heavy tax load on St. Michaels homeowners, while those who benefit most are taxed the least, or not at all in the case of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum,\" the issues brief states.At the meeting, Commission President David Breimhurst said he was glad that the Historic District Residents Association is offering to be part of the solution. He suggested getting all stakeholders from every aspect of the community together to talk and see what they can come up with.\"I don't think it needs to be 'us against them' or adversarial in any way,\" he said. \"Just to have a calm, adult discussion about where we stand.\" Dan Spiegel spoke on behalf of the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association at the meeting Wednesday.He summarized some of the points made in the issues brief and named the four steps the group hopes the commissioners will take:▪ Begin a period of study and assessment of the tax options other towns use to raise revenue from business activities.▪ Engage with the Maritime Museum to urge they make a payment in lieu of taxes to the town.▪ Hold public hearings to discuss any plans that may develop.▪ Look at current residential property rates to determine whether they are \"fair and appropriate,\" in the case that the town raises additional revenue from businesses.Spiegel said that most of the money the town uses to fund services and maintain its infrastructure comes from property taxes.He said that, based on data gathered from the state, there are 81 business structures that pay property taxes in town, compared to 796 homes and non-business structures.\"In other words, only 9% of the property taxes are paid by businesses,\" he said.Spiegel said that although Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is the \"crown jewel\" of the town's tourist economy, it is tax exempt and does not make any voluntary payments directly to the town. These types of payments are known as payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\"Many universities and colleges pay PILOTs to towns because of their use of the infrastructure and other things that impact the town,\" he said. \"The museum makes no PILOT payments.\" Spiegel also said money generated by businesses does not stay in the town. He said that 97% of the town's commercial buildings are owned by non-residents and more than 90% of the business operators who rent the buildings are also non-residents.\"So non-resident landlords, business operators and employees spend their money elsewhere because there are very few normal types of businesses that they can spend money on that would attract their dollars,\" he said.After Spiegel spoke, Commissioner Tad DuPont said this conversation has already begun.\"You're stimulating a conversation, but it has started,\" he said.DuPont said that with the changing tourist economy, St.Michaels needs to change with it and be ahead of it.Commission Treasurer Al Mercier said he could envision multiple areas where the town could generate more revenue, including a tourism tax, an alcohol tax, an accommodations tax and parking meters.\"These are nine or 10 things that I think we need to put on the agenda going forward,\" he said.During public comment, Kristen Greenaway, president and CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, talked about what the museum pays the town, including an annual event fees tax, and what services it offers residents.She said the museum offers free after school and summer programming for local and Talbot County youth, free museum membership for St. Michaels' youth and free entry for locals with passes that can be obtained at the library.Greenaway said the taxes on The Crab Claw restaurant property, which the museum is purchasing, will still be paid, as it will remain zoned as maritime commercial.Spiegel said the Historic District Residents Association is not anti-museum or anti-business.\"This is an informal group of residents that were organized, that live in the historic district, that are concerned about the future of St. Michaels,\" he said.John Marrah, a property owner in St. Michaels, said he enjoyed the Historic District Residents Association presentation.\"It's important that people think they're treated fairly from a taxation standpoint,\" he said.Marrah added that business and property owners are taxed \"with no representation\" in St.Michaels. He said that might be something the town should look into.\"I own properties in town, but since I don't live in town, I can't vote,\" he said. \"I pay property taxes like everybody else.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDan Spiegel speaks about St. Michaels tax rates on behalf of the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association at a Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting on Nov. 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And although no bids were cast, there was a lot of interest in these boats, all of which have been donated to the museum.\nEach boat has a story. Kristen Greenaway, president and chief executive officer of CBMM, knows many of these stories. On Thursday, she noted a little wooden sailboat with a well-maintained sheen. It was designed in the 1930s.\n\"This is a Chesapeake Bay locally designed boat,\" she said. \"The chap who designed it put a couple of designs together. It was great for sailing upwind, and when it was sailing downwind, it would kind of flop from one side to the other. The wife of the chap he asked 'What did it look like?' She said it looked like a penguin waddling from side to side. So he named it 'penguin' and they are all painted with a black hull,\" Greenaway said.\nThe auction has a large reach.\n\"People come from far and wide to come in here and just have a phenomenal day kicking fenders, not kicking tires. And just having fun and maybe finding something to take home,\" she said.\nThis is the first year the museum has implemented reserves, or minimum bids.\nThe range of possibility is staggering. There was a 46-foot trawler with $15,000 minimum. There was jet ski with just 40 hours of running time. There was a whole section of boats at the auction that were floating at the dock. Some of the boats needed some care, but most were ready to hit the water.\nLad Mills, is longtime CBMM worker who retired five years ago. He just came to observe and scope out the offerings for a friend. He had some thoughts as man who helped found the auction event.\n\"You have to have enough, having is cleaned, and presented properly and having the proper crowd. Auctions are fun to watch because people get excited. People get emotional and people don't want anyone else to get their boat,\" Mills said.\n\"It does people a lot of good to be able to get rid of boats they have and don't want. I like old boats. I still fiddle with old boats. I am not a perfectionist, but I like to resurrect boats,\" Mills said.\nThe boat auction is important for the museum, Greenaway said.\n\"The boat donation program as a whole is extremely important because the funds from the sales of the boats go directly into the mission. It is phenomenal that people actually trust us enough to donate their vessels to us so we can sell them to put that revenue back into achieving the mission,\" she said.\nThe Charity Boat Auction will take place on Saturday ,Aug. 31. The doors open at 8 a.m. and the bidding starts at 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's a four-letter word and certainly not ideal under any circumstances.Being debt-free is always better than being in debt. But not all debt is created equal. Generally, debt comes in two flavors: secured and unsecured.Secured debts are collateralized.That means the borrower pledges something of value to the lender that acts like a security deposit.If the borrower defaults, the lender gets ownership of that valuable asset. A home mortgage is probably the best example of reasonably safe, secured debt.In a mortgage, the property becomes the collateral.Unsecured debts, on the other hand, are wild and crazy because there is no security. Even worse, invariably, this kind of debt comes with double-digit interest rates. All it takes is the borrower's signature and the deed is done. This kind of debt is not safe, in fact it is toxic.Unsecured debt can ruin a life. Credit card debt is the best example of toxic debt. It looks so harmless.It offers so much convenience and flexibility. And nothing could be further from the truth. Unsecured consumer debt is like a steel trap armed with attractive bait to lure you in. Then, once you're in, it slams shut.I've been in the debt trap.It's a horrible place to be. It took me 13 years to gnaw my way out of a six-figure load of unsecured, toxic debt. My husband (a man of both of both long-suffering and integrity) and I didn't file for bankruptcy.We repaid every dime including interest, penalties and fees.I didn't get into the debt trap against my will. I did it to myself, naively and stupidly.I nibbled at that delicious bait. I chose to ignore the signs warning that I was heading for trouble if I didn't change my ways. I paid a terrible price for acting so foolishly.

He famously appeared with his former fellow stars in the 2021 streaming special \"Friends: The Reunion,\" which still can be found on Max, and it's quite touching to watch the embraces and memories shared by him and the other five actors with whom he shared so much time - and success - over the decade-long run of that much-repeated show (which was seen originally on NBC).LeBlanc also was part of a 2021 \"Top Gear\" special that paid tribute to the late race driver Sabine Schmitz, who appeared often on that BBC series. LeBlanc's presence on that special acknowledged his own presence on \"Top Gear\" as a presenter on episodes that were spread over four seasons, after his participation as a guest. He was required to be in England to make the show, and he ultimately decided to leave that job and remain largely in the U.S.It's not new for LeBlanc to take extended breaks from television work.He also did that after the NBC run of the \"Friends\" spinoff \"Joey,\" and what was planned as one year off became five, with the actor eventually returning (and playing a variation of himself) in the Showtime comedy series \"Episodes.\" He won a Golden Globe Award for that show, then he spent four seasons on \"Man With a Plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Digging and cooking sweet potatoes\n\n October 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1317\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of the last large gardening jobs to do when I was young was to dig those sweet potatoes.My parents would gently loosen the soil around the plants and take a peek at the plants whose leaves were slightly yellow and turning back. These were the signs the potatoes were ready to dig. The baskets for storage were already pulled out and waiting for the big day.\nMy family enjoyed growing sweet potatoes, as once planted they required very little attention and were drought tolerant. They grew in their own space — not sprouting and growing wildly. We ate a lot of both the white potato and the sweet potato, a major staple on the winter dinner table.\nThe Saturday for digging was chosen, the family notified, the tractor with attached farm wagon readied, and the shed prepared for storage next to the crop of white potatoes already completed.\nThe pickup trucks lined the lane as family and friends arrived for the digging. After several cups of Ms. Laura's coffee, the crew began working.\nMy sister and I were assigned the job of \"getting the dinner ready.\" This was not a dinner — it was a small banquet. Mom had made two pots of soup. One was homemade vegetable beef, and the other was lima bean soup. Waiting to be baked were several dozens of homemade biscuits.\nI wanted to get outside to help, but oh no, my sister needed help with the dishes. No paper plates or bowls could be found on West Line Road.\nLet's enjoy these fresh dug sweet potatoes with some old and new recipes.\nSWEET POTATO CHIPS2 large sweet potatoes, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp sea salt.\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees and position the oven rack in the center of the oven. Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible (1/8 inch thick slices). If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not \"chip\" crispiness. Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt.\nLay out in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. Thickness of slices will impact cooking time. Check at 10-minute intervals during the second hour of cooking to ensure they aren't burning. Remove once crisp and golden brown. Some may feel a little tender in the middle but take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes or so to crisp up before sampling. Serve immediately.\nSWEET POTATO PANCAKES1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tbsp packed brown sugar, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1 3/4 cup buttermilk, 2 small sweet potatoes (roasted and pureed until smooth), 2 large eggs, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, butter for cooking and serving.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk and sweet potato puree, then add eggs and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. When butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and ladle a scant ½ cup pancake batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form in batter and the pancake is golden underneath, about 3 minutes, then flip and cook the other side until golden, another 3 minutes. Serve with more butter, toasted pecans and maple syrup.\nSWEET POTATO CASSEROLE2 lb. sweet potatoes, extra virgin olive oil for drizzling, Kosher salt, 1/2 cup unsalted butter (room temperature) plus more for pan, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs (beaten to blend), 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. BROWN SUGAR CRUST: 1/2 cup chopped raw pecans, 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tbsp unsalted butter (melted).\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a 11-by-7-inch (or 2-quart) baking dish with foil. Rinse and scrub potatoes to dislodge any dirt, then pat dry. Using a fork, poke holes all over the potatoes. Drizzle with oil; season all over with salt. Transfer potatoes to prepared pan and roast, uncovered, until cooked through and flesh is easily pierced with a fork or paring knife, 60 to 65 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a large heatproof bowl. Discard foil and grease pan with butter. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove skins.\nIn the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl, using an electric mixer), beat potatoes and granulated sugar on medium speed until sugar is incorporated and potatoes are mashed. Add butter and beat until incorporated and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, vanilla, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and beat until mixture is almost doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into the prepared pan and spread with a spatula. Bake the casserole until the center is set but slightly jiggly and edges are beginning to brown, about 35 minutes. Let cool slightly.\nBROWN SUGAR CRUST: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine pecans, brown sugar, flour, and salt, breaking up any clumps of sugar with your fingers. Drizzle in butter and toss with a fork until combined. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture over potatoes. Continue to bake the casserole until the crust is firm and starts to brown, about 10 minutes more. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nSWEET POTATO BISCUITS9 ounces all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 4 ounces cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch cubes, 9 ounces sweet potato purée from one large sweet potato, 3 ounces milk.\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400 degrees. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl, then whisk until well combined (this may take up to 1 minute). Add the butter, toss to break up the pieces, and smash each cube flat. Continue smashing and rubbing until the butter has mostly disappeared into a floury mix, although a few larger, Cheerio-sized pieces may remain.\nThis can also be done with 4 or 5 pulses in a food processor, just take care not to overdo it. The prepared mix can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks in an airtight container, then used as directed below. Mash the sweet potato purée and milk together with a fork, or combine with an immersion blender until perfectly smooth. Add to the dry mix in a large bowl, and fold with a flexible spatula until fully absorbed. The dough will seem rather crumbly and dry at first, but keep mixing until it finally comes together. Once the dough forms a rough ball, turn out onto a lightly floured surface. With your bare hands, gently pat the dough into a squarish shape about 1/2-inch thick, then fold in half; repeat twice more for a total of 3 folds, using only enough flour to keep your hands from sticking.\nFinish by patting the dough to a thickness of 3/4 inch. If needed, dust away any excess flour, then cut into 1 3/4-inch rounds and arrange in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Gather scraps into a ball, pat and fold a single time, then cut as many more biscuits as you can. The final round of scraps can be gathered and shaped into a single biscuit by hand. Bake until the biscuits are well-risen and golden brown, about 25 minutes (or longer if cut thicker than 3/4-inch). Let the biscuits cool about 5 minutes to help set their crumb, then serve. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Elmer Davis was outspoken Monday evening about bringing his constituents relief from the odors they smell during crab season.\n\"Constituents in the neighborhood should not have to go through another season of having to endure that kind of odor,\" Davis said. \"And if the business is friendly and working with the community, something of this nature should have been worked out prior to now.\"\nThe ordinance, which will go into effect later this month, requires that seafood processing operations install odor control technology \"in such a manner that no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building on the same property or on adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nZach Smith, an attorney representing Chesapeake Brand Seafood, said the business' concerns center the spray application system it plans to install — which will cost around $20,000 and may not fulfill the town's new requirements of \"no odor\" being detectable.\n\"We're confident it will address the issue, at least to some extent,\" Smith said. \"But we're not confident, not necessarily confident, it'll meet that standard.\"\nSmith requested a compromise, stating he thinks the ordinance should not retroactively apply to \"existing, lawful seafood processing uses\" such as his client. He submitted proposed revisions to the ordinance that were read aloud Monday evening.\nFollowing a lengthy council discussion, Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said he was ready to pass the ordinance as written, without Smith's proposed changes. Council President Frank Gunsallus agreed those changes were \"overly specific.\"\nAbatiello made a motion to approve the ordinance, which was seconded by Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry. Gunsallus and Davis joined in voting yes. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nTIMELINE DEBATEIn the approved ordinance, businesses must comply with odor control and storage requirements by July 1, 2025. Prior to Monday, the compliance date on the draft ordinance was Jan. 1, 2026. The change stirred discussion Monday evening.\nDavis pushed for that date to be even sooner — Jan. 1, 2025 — though he was outnumbered by Gunsallus, Abatiello, and Curry, who all voted in favor of amending the ordinance to the July date.\nCurry maintained that it's important the town be fair to the business since it's planning to pay up for the new odor control system to address the problem.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said she had legal concerns about shortening the period, saying that \"even January (2026)\" is pushing it.\n\"They've had time to comply,\" Davis said.\n\"But they didn't have this ordinance,\" VanEmburgh responded. \"The ordinance is what would be challenged.\"\n\"I mean the worst case scenario is that we go to court, and is that the end result? Then so be it,\" said Davis. \" … If you say comply by 2026, just think about this for a moment. The same people who live in Ward 4 have to suffer through this this year again until January 2026.\"\n\"I have to stand on what I believe in, and I believe that they've already had enough time to do it,\" Davis later stated. \"It seems to me that we're more worried about going to court than listening to the people. And I think we should listen to the people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "There are other options open to poultry farmers\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DR. ASHA SUBRAMANIAN | Section: News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a physician, I have been following closely our country's bird flu crisis. I was saddened but not surprised to learn that, within days of each other, bird flu was detected for the first time on an Eastern Shore poultry farm and our country experienced the death of its first patient from H5N1 bird flu in Louisiana.My colleagues and I are watchful for symptoms of bird flu and are hopeful that Maryland does not join the list of states in which more than 60 human cases of bird flu have been detected. I applaud our public health officials for doing what they can to keep the bird flu from spreading but the reality is that the virus has sickened dozens of people, decimated poultry populations and infected dairy cows.\nThankfully, our state is doing a good job of monitoring for the virus. But now is the time to take a hard look at the food production system that puts farm workers in close contact with sick birds and cows, the Standard American Diet that demands it and the health ramifications of both.\nFrom a doctor's perspective, shifting food production away from intensive animal agriculture can benefit public health. Facilities with large numbers of animals in a small amount of space are a concern for public health because they provide ideal conditions for viruses to spread, evolve and possibly acquire the ability to more easily infect people. Intensive animal agriculture was implicated when influenza viruses H1N1, H5N1 and N7N9 jumped from animals to people, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology.\nThe life of a contract chicken grower can be challenging, and some of them are repurposing their chicken houses to grow crops. I was not surprised to learn that North Carolina poultry farmers Dale and Paula Boles switched from chickens, converted their 500-foot-long poultry barn to a greenhouse and now grow organic vegetables. They are not alone. In Southwest Arkansas, farmers Jennifer and Rodney Barrett are transitioning from raising poultry and cattle to growing mushrooms.\nThese farm transitions aren't easy. The government should provide financial and technical support. Maryland could help its farmers with a program like the one established by lawmakers in Vermont who provide grants to farmers who wish to diversify or transition from one type of farming to another. On a broader scale, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide grants to livestock farmers to pay off related debt and to transition the property to alternative agriculture activities. Maryland's U.S. Sens. Van Hollen and Alsobrooks should support this legislation to help ensure that it passes.\nAccording to the USDA, \"Maryland is small, but it reaches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains, providing a suitable environment for a variety of agricultural commodities,\" which means lots of opportunities for farmers. Sweet corn, hazelnuts, watermelons, grapes, as well as apple, cherry and peach orchards are just a few promising options.\nShifting away from animal agriculture helps our environment and improves worker safety as well. Maryland's poultry farms are a primary source of water, air and land pollution. Improving the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is another reason to increase acreage of fruit and nut trees. One way to keep phosphorous and other pollutants from flowing into rivers is to install riparian buffers of trees and shrubs to intercept polluted water running off of fields where chicken litter has been applied. Trees that are suitable for riparian buffers, like hazelnuts can also provide income to farmers.\nI have found for myself and my patients that removing animal products from the diet improves health too. A plant-based diet focused on fruits, veggies, legumes and grains grown in Maryland can help maintain healthy weight, lower blood pressure and improve heart health.\nI know this from my own personal experience and from treating patients with diet-related diseases, and the scientific literature tells the same story. A recent study with 22 pairs of identical twins found that a plant-based diet improves heart health in as little as eight weeks. The twins following a plant-based diet experienced lower LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, and they lost more weight than the omnivore twins.\nGovernment grants and other assistance should also be available if Maryland poultry farmers or egg producers would like to switch to growing crops and planting orchards, which will also benefit human health and the environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Charles Gailunas, his wife Erika Gailunas and two daughters, Caroline and Charlotte Gailunas, participated in the race together.\nEvery time the Gailunas family runs it's a full circle moment on how Charles and Erika met.\n\"We've been running this as long as we've lived here, five years now we've been doing this event,\" Charles Gailunas said. \"My wife and I actually met because of a 5K, so it's a little bit of a family history.\"\nRunners sported their St.Patricks Day green with one running in an inflated leprechaun suit.\nThe winner of the 5K race was 15-year-old Miguel Castro with a time of 20:45.

Even though it was written for him at a younger age, Lee said Jourdan still claims the title. \"I am the Night Owl,' she said Jourdan would say.\nAs the story developed, the youngsters peppered Lee with comments and questions, showing they knew about the planets, their names and unique qualities. To her right, Brown kept up, turning the pages so each of the colorful pages could be seen.\nBrown, who is from Centreville and now lives in Baltimore, has been a Toys For Tots Youth Ambassador for three years. She got involved through her American Heritage Girls troop.

Local veterans and residents gathered April 28 to dedicate the monument to these long-overlooked heroes.The soldiers served in the United States Colored Troops, which consisted of free and enslaved African Americans who fought for the Union during the Civil War. Queen Anne's County has identified about 435 men from across the county who served in these units, according to local historian Chris Pupke.\nMaryland contributed more than 8,000 men to the United States Colored Troops, and by the end of the war, Black soldiers represented about 10% of the Union force, he said.\nQueen Anne's County soldiers predominantly served in the 19th, 39th and 7th regiments, and participated in battles and sieges instrumental to turning the tide of the war and shaping the history of the divided nation, he said.\n\"These men, these heroes, fought, bled and died for this country and we are grateful,\" Pupke said.\nFollowing the war, these men started schools, built churches, searched for loved ones sold into slavery, and helped create the community known today, he said.\n\"Too often today their stories remain missing from our history books, from our community conversations, and from family histories,\" Pupke said.\nWhile more work is necessary to continually recognize the tremendous sacrifices made for freedom, \"today we celebrate these heroes, their bravery and sacrifices, accomplishments and contributions to our community,\" he said.\nAn initiative more than a year in the making, members of the Centreville Veterans Information Committee as well as local artists, masons, community members and county commissioners helped bring the project to fruition.\nKennard African American Cultural Heritage Center Executive Director Tara Coursey noted it was incredible to recognize the legacies of county Civil War soldiers.\nKennard stands as the repository of African American history in the county, so it is only fitting the plaque found a home there, she said.\nPerforming a dedication prayer, Deacon Frank Hessen of St. Christopher's said, \"With courage born of hope they marched from this very soil answering the call to defend the dignity of all people and forge a nation united in liberty. Their sacrifice, steadfastness, and unwavering resolve inspire us still, reminding us of the cost of freedom and the power of unity in the face of adversity.\"\nCommittee member Robert Simms teared up at the performance of taps dedicating the plaque. As a Vietnam-era veteran, Simms understood the loss of friends to war as well as a lack of recognition upon returning home.\nNoting the plaque's meaningfulness to him and others, \"It's been a pleasure to be part of this group,\" Simms said.\nThe Centreville Veterans Information Committee looks forward to the eventual installation of a 6-foot statue to further honor Queen Anne's County United States Colored Troops.\nThe committee's Veterans Coffee House welcomes veterans supporting veterans community and conversations every Monday at the American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 at 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You will hear some success stories today,\" Price said.\nThe back row of the courtroom was packed with people supporting the graduates — Nichole Meredith, Samantha Mitchell and Carole Rawding. There were tearful testimonies to the power of this program. Love ones were showed the before and after pictures that marked the women's journey from the beginning of the program to the end.\nProblem Solving Coordinator Michelle Bethke spoke to the journey these women have taken and she presented certificates and flowers.\nEach graduate had a presenter. Meredith had lawyer Dana Boston, Mitchell had Whitely, and Rawding had Bethke.\nThere were lots of local dignitaries present, including Caroline County Commissioner Larry Porter, Sheriff Don Baker, Police Chief Geroge Bacorn and State's Attorney Sloan Franklin. Even Roger McKnight, MTU program administrator, was there.\nFrom state to county to town, there was community supporting these women to break the cycle of addiction and incarceration.\n\"It is an achievement and we are sending our graduates back out into the world to do good things,\" Price said.\nPrice noted the rigor of the program. Collectively the three graduates had submitted 382 drug tests. They completed 313 treatments of either substance abuse disorder or mental health treatment. They had to complete 146.25 hours of community service.\nBethke went up to the podium and addressed the crowded court room.\n\"The Caroline County Problem Solving Court employs science-based best practices to provide a pathway to sobriety for participants with diagnosed substance use disorders utilizing a combination of therapy, counseling, mentoring, encouragement and discipline when necessary,\" Bethke said.\nThe program received a $200,000 grant from the Maryland Office of Problem Solving Courts through a sub grant of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which helped provide the program's staffing.\nA graduate from 2022's program, and keynote speaker at the May 10 graduation, is Whiteley.\n\"I am a recovering addict and alumni from the Problem Solving Court. The definition of recovery is the process of change for which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life and strive,\" she said. \"The mindset and thinking pattern I once had, I needed to give up in order to change. Today I am a strong worthy loving and lovable woman, mother and friend.\"\nThe next speaker was Meredith.\n\"My addiction had taken everything that I ever loved away from me. I lost custody of my kids. I lost the trust and respect of my family. When I looked into the mirror, I didn't even recognize the person staring back at me,\" Meredith said. \"This program has saved my life. I have full custody of my kids now. My family and friends can depend on me.\"\nThe next to speak was Mitchell.\n\"Drug court has given me the resources I need when I need people,\" Mitchell said.\nThe final graduate, Rawding, was introduced by Bethke.

He felt like there was a little unfinished business, and he knew he wanted to get back and have another chance at the same young man,\" Warrior boys head tennis coach Aaron Hutt said.\nHershey came within a win of becoming the first boys singles player to win a state title in school — and North Bayside — history a year ago, only to be denied by Poolesville's Andy Wu in the Class 2A final.\nCarrying an 18-0 record into this year's state tournament, Hershey was on course for a rematch with Wu. That second chance was foiled though, when Hereford's Harry Smith defeated Hershey, 7-5, 6-2 in the semifinals.\nWith his hopes for a rematch and a state title gone, the recently-graduated Hershey could have easily packed his bag and made the long, slow drive back from the Wilde Lake Tennis Club in Columbia to Easton in heavy Memorial Day weekend traffic. Instead, the senior fell back on the family, friends and teammates that watched him play May 23.\n\"I owe a lot of that to my family and the people I was there with; my teammates,\" Hershey said of moving forward. \"(Teammate) Clay Nagle, similar situation happened to him and his partner, Parker Jimenez (who lost in the mixed doubles semifinals).

Milton Wright's Xavier Moaddel, 6-0, 6-4 in the third-place match, capping a 20-1 season in singles play that earned him the North Bayside's boys tennis player of the year as voted on by the division's coaches.\nNagle and Jimenez also rebounded from their semifinal loss, defeating Wilde Lake's Jakob Bluemner and Jillian Davis, 6-0, 6-0 in the third-place match in 2A mixed doubles.\n\"There's an old saying: You can let it go to your heart for a moment, but you can't let it go to your head,\" Hutt said of the disappointment that comes from a loss. \"And he was able to compartmentalize that loss, granted being very upset. But after a few hours, he put it together and said, 'OK, next challenge.' It's a testament not just to his resilience, but the experience he's gotten from traveling and playing some pretty high-level tennis.\"\nThat experience helped Hershey go undefeated during the regular season in singles, compile a 14-1 record in doubles, and win a third straight Class 2A East Region II singles title. And though he did not get a second crack at Wu — who went on to win a third straight 2A state title — Hershey showed growth through the season.\n\"I think he matured, and his ability to not be his own worst enemy was apparent,\" Hutt said of Hershey, who was 57-2 over four years in the regular season, and intends to continue playing at Catholic University. \"Last year, and past years, something might not go quite right and he internalized it automatically, forgetting that the other person has something to do with it as well. And that's kind of what greatness does. It looks at what it needs to do initially, and then it realizes, it's not just what I need to do, it's what I need to do to stop them as well. He got very good at that. Not only that, but being able to play every game as its own little match. He only lost a handful of games let alone sets.\"\nSt. Michaels' boys team didn't lose a match this season until the Bayside Conference championship, where it fell 4-3 to Stephen Decatur. But that was the lone blemish on a season of firsts for St. Michaels tennis, earning 11-year head coach Jordan Miller the North Bayside boys coach of the year.\n\"I knew we were going to be a very strong team,\" Miller said. \"I worked with throughout the year most of the players that we see. So I know what we have. And I also know what everybody else has. I knew our guys were putting in a lot of work. And that was going to be very helpful.\"\nOne year after falling shy of the division via a 4-3 loss against North Caroline, St. Michaels dominated its North competition with an 18-1 overall record, winning 14 matches by 7-0 scores, and three others by 6-1 margins. The Saints not only won their first division title and reached the conference championship for the first time, they earned a fourth consecutive 1A East Region I crown.\nSt. Michaels wasn't quite finished though.\nLexi Rockwell and Tom Weller teamed to win the school's first state tennis championship, when they won the 1A mixed doubles crown. That effort, coupled with Sean Kline and Miles Fox finishing third in boys doubles, and Tess Weller placing fourth in girls singles, helped the Saints take runner-up honors in the 1A team competition at states — another program first — by just one point.\n\"It was definitely a good feeling,\" Miller said.\nIt may also prove to be good motivation for next season.\n\"I talked with my assistant (Casey Capute),\" Miller said. \"We didn't like coming home with the second-place trophy as a team for states. And we didn't like coming home with a second-place (at Baysides). I hate for us to be, 'OK, we got a state championship and we're happy with that.'\n\"Prior to coming back (as head coach), I never knew what we were capable of,\" added Miller, a St. Michaels graduate. \"But the more I coached, the more I saw opportunities for us, if we could just get a few kids to really buy in. And now we've got quite a few more than a few kids that have bought in. And I think we're going to be able to hopefully maintain that for many years to come.\nHere's a look at the rest of the this year's teams\nFIRST TEAMSebastian Cousineau, So., Kent County\nBecame the first in school history to reach a state championship, where he lost in the 1A final to Boonsboro senior Hunter Liao, who became the state's first four-time state champion in boys singles. Cousineau was 13-2 in singles — his only other loss coming against Easton's Hershey — and 6-4 in doubles. The sophomore beat Colonel Richardson's Jeffrey Lin, 6-2, 6-4 to win 1A East I title.\nMiles Fox, Jr., St. Michaels\nFox was 14-2 in singles, which included a win against Decatur at Baysides. Teamed with Sean Kline in doubles, posting a 16-0 conference record, and a 21-1 overall mark. The tandem beat Decatur at Bayside, won the 1A East I boys doubles title with a 6-0, 6-0 sweep of Perryville's Holden Coe and Tyler Loss, and reached the state semifinals. Defeated Southern Garrett's Ben Nazelrod and Shane Sisler, 6-1, 6-2 in consolation final.\nSean Kline, So., St. Michaels\nKline posted a 13-3 singles mark during the regular season, losing only to Hershey, Cousineau and Queen Anne's County's Tyler Olah — all first-team all-North picks.\nLost singles match against Decatur at Baysides before he and Fox won the boys doubles title at regionals and took third at states.\nTyler Olah, Sr., Queen Anne's\nThe Lions' No. 1 went 14-5 in singles, 8-5 in doubles. He won the 2A East I singles championship with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over North East's Brady Dvorak. Lost in 2A state quarterfinals to Poolesville's Wu.\nSECOND TEAMTom Weller, Sr., St. Michaels; Clay Nagel, Sr., Easton; Christian Chase, Jr., North Dorchester; Bjorn Birkmire, So., Kent County; Will Taylor, Fr., Queen Anne's.\nHONORABLE MENTIONCambridge-SD: Jayden Mitchell, So.; Colonel Richardson: Jeffrey Lin, Jr.; Easton: Liam Edgell, Sr.; Lucas Myers, Jr.; Kent County: Teo O'Brien, Sr.; Robert Hague, Sr.; Kent Island: Dylan Bankard, Sr.; Carson Alplanalp, Sr.; North Caroline: Justin Hoover, So.; Jonnatan Luna, Jr.; Hayden Lukacsina, Sr.\nQueen Anne's: Ryan Breeding, Sr.; St. Michaels: Sebastian Cornish, Jr.; Willy Coale, So., Jeremiah Monroe, So. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The photos of Ellie Griffin, Norah Smith, Harrison Bonovitch, Arthur Schaefer and Josiah Gross were selected from more than 2,600 entries in the society's call for photos.\nEllie, Norah and Arthur are from St. Mary's County and Harrison and Josiah are from Calvert County. Their photos will be displayed on two screens in Times Square above Dos Caminos restaurant in Father Duffy Square.\nEllie is 5 and was diagnosed with Down syndrome when she was born, Jessica Griffin, Ellie's mom, said. Ellie was also selected to be in the video in 2022, but this is the first time the family is going to New York to see it.\n\"I can't wait to see her reaction,\" Griffin said before the event. \"Hopefully she realizes what's happening.\"\nWhile Ellie might not understand everything that's happening, her 8-year-old brother is excited and \"thinks she's famous,\" the mother said.\nOutside of the national society, the family participates with other Down syndrome organizations, Griffin said. They do fundraisers with the Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network and have raised over $20,000 to connect families who are new to the condition, in which a person is born with an extra chromosome causing mild to moderate cognitive disability, developmental delays and physical challenges.\n\"It's amazing the support that we get through our community,\" Griffin said.\nGriffin is also a parent volunteer with Jack's Baskets, which hand delivers baskets with gifts and resources for families to celebrate babies with Down syndrome.\nThe Times Square video presentation kicks off the New York City Buddy Walk. The walk has taken place in New York City since 1995 as part of the National Buddy Walk Program.\nThe National Down Syndrome Society video allows Ellie and the other Southern Maryland residents to advocate the message of inclusion, Griffin said. The photos were taken by 21FIVE Photography by Teresa Tucker, a resident in Southern Maryland who did free photoshoots for the kids to submit to the society.\n\"Everyone's goal is to support their kids and help them be the best versions of themselves,\" Griffin said.\nEllie does not have a lot of words, but she is a huge Taylor Swift fan, Griffin said. When Swift plays Ellie screams \"Tay Tay\" and starts dancing and singing.\n\"She's been hitting a lot of the words to the songs,\" Griffen said. \"We think it's actually helped improve her language and speech skills.\"\nThe presentation was slated to be live-streamed on the National Down Syndrome Society Facebook page from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 6. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Delean-Botkin, who did not seek re-election, was appointed to the commission seat in June 2023 following the resignation of former Commissioner Brian Wells.\nThe person elected to the position will serve a three-year term. On June 18, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Oxford voters can head to the Oxford Community Services Building at 101 Market St. to cast their vote.\nNORMAN BELLOxford resident Norman Bell, 79, is retired from a 45-year career at DuPont. He has municipal government experience through volunteerism, including being chair of the Oxford Planning Commission, president of the Oxford Community Center, chair of the Oxford Hiring Procedures Ad Hoc Committee, and member of the Sea Level Rise and Stormwater Steering Team. Bell has a wife, Paula, two sons and two granddaughters.\nWhy are you running?\n\"We need to calm the divisive atmosphere that is keeping us from moving forward. The people of Oxford have a history of working together to make significant accomplishments. I believe that every resident wants to continue this history of success. I have developed a skillset, through my professional and volunteer experiences, that can help to make this happen. I want to partner with the people of Oxford, in whom I believe, to plan and build for a successful future.\"\nWhat will you bring to the commission?\n\"I began volunteering in Oxford after moving here 12 years ago. I have experience working with town government committees and nonprofit organizations. During my 45-year career with DuPont, I developed skills managing teams, and the ability to encourage people to work toward consensus. I found these skills very helpful in my work as chair of the Oxford Planning Commission, president of the Oxford Community Center, chair of the Oxford Hiring Practices Policy Committee, and as a member of the Sea Level Rise and Stormwater Steering Team. Those responsibilities required full time commitment. As commissioner, I will be equally devoted to my responsibilities.\"\nWhat would you say is the most pressing issue facing Oxford and how do you think the commissioners need to address it?\n\"As of July 1 , five of the 11 town employees, including hopefully a new town manager, will have less than six months of experience as Oxford town employees. This is the most pressing short-term issue. Our attention to the professional development of these new employees will ensure the continuation of services to our residents. Our most long-term pressing issue is sea level rise. The commissioners need to address it by empowering citizens to be engaged in helping to find solutions.\"\nDo you feel that the town and commissioners have done a good job of addressing sea level rise and flooding in Oxford? Why or why not?\n\"The town has been addressing the flooding issue. A comprehensive flood plan was developed, priorities set and grant funding obtained. Detailed engineering studies, necessary to begin the actual design and implementation work, were just approved. Could it have been done in a more expeditious manner? Starting the work depended upon grant funding availability.\nSea level rise is a longer-term issue. As a good first step, the town commissioned a study to assess the future impact of sea level rise on Oxford and its residents. The next step is to empower already engaged citizens in helping to find solutions to this long-term issue. I am a part of the steering team, which is developing that process.\"\nJOSHUA CODERCoder is a Oxford volunteer firefighter and EMT. According to his campaign website, Joshua Coder has a degree in international affairs and economics and a master's degree in geology. His website says he has experience with permitting, environmental compliance, construction, water management, managing budgets and managing audit documentation and financial disclosures. It says he is an Army veteran.\nCoder declined to respond to the Star Democrat's questions and instead directed the newspaper to his website. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is an eye sore. I finally found an entrance and walked up and down the beach, surveying the project's progress.\nIt was a beautifully sunny Tuesday afternoon, and the Strand sat virtually empty other than a resident walking her dog and two girls tanning. The resident, who has lived in Oxford for decades, said the beach used to always be packed.\nThe fencing surrounding the beach and the living shoreline operate to support vegetation growth so the town doesn't have to replant every year.\nBut commissioners don't know how long the fencing will be up — could be a season, could be multiple. You can read more about it in the story below.\nAlso in today's newsletter: Talbot County approved DAF legislation, Sheriff Donnie Baker visited the White House, Talbot County dives into student test data and sports.\nThanks for reading. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget discussions kicked off at Talbot Board of Ed work session\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education was presented with preliminary budget considerations during a Monday work session as planning for the fiscal year 2026 budget is underway.Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones outlined the priorities her team is focusing on. Those priorities include achieving academic equity in math, fostering an engaging environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining staff members.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said those areas were determined as priorities during a board retreat last year.\n\"When the dust all ended, we said that these were the three priorities that we wanted to move forward with,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then most recently, we've talked about special education being a focus for us as well.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided an overview of the budget process and how the state's expansive 10-year education funding initiative, The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, allocates money on a per-student basis.\n\"Every student in our system grades (K-12) qualifies for a base amount, and that's called our foundation funding,\" Jones said. \"That's how we keep our lights on. That's how we have insurance.\"\nThen, depending on student classifications in other categories, such as multilingual learners and special education, more money is allocated to a school. Each school receives different funding based on their enrollment statistics, Jones said.\nShe added that the expectation from the state is that \"at least 75%\" of the money given toward a certain school is \"spent directly at that school.\" Costs related to human resources, finance and transportation often aren't school-specific.\nAccording to Jones, the district needs to \"make some shifts\" in two programs — compensatory education and multilingual learners — in order to comply with Blueprint requirements. No district in the state is fully compliant at this time, she noted, but the Blueprint Accountability & Implementation Board is seeking progress.\n\"We're just not spending enough money on those areas to meet criteria,\" Jones said.\nPepukayi said the strict requirements affect funding for smaller schools, a topic that's come up in her discussions with fellow superintendents on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The foundation funding is insufficient to do all that we need to do, particularly for the smaller schools, the districts that have smaller schools,\" she said. \" … It's compliance-driven and rigidness for our budgeting versus giving us the flexibility to make those decisions and differentiate ourselves.\"\nSchools and departments in the district submit budgets every year, along with providing a list of requested positions. Position requests include teachers, coaches, English second language professionals, special education staff and social workers.\n\"We're not at the level where we were at last year,\" Jones added.\nBoard President Emily Jackson brought up whether or not the district could revisit previous hopes to hire someone for a grants manager position since managing grants is a significant stress on the finance department.\nJones said it's \"burdensome\" to track all of the necessary results and data from grants.\n\"You have to have a really detailed knowledge of the public education landscape to be able to write those grants, I would say,\" Jones said. \"And that was our challenge.\"\nHowever, Jones was optimistic on the prospect that a grants manager could eventually help Talbot County Public Schools bring in more revenue.\n\"Hiring a grant person might make sense financially,\" she said. \"They might at least be able to pay for themselves, and then hopefully generate some revenue in other ways.\"\nThe Talbot County Board of Education will meet with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 7 to discuss a proposed budget. The proposed budget will first be brought to the board at a Jan. 13 work session, and then on Jan. 15 for first reader.\nAs of now, a public hearing on the budget is scheduled for Feb. 10, with a potential board vote slated for Feb. 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As pressures to increase solar mount, Caroline County examines options to hold its ground\n\n December 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 770\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — During a discussion of solar policy Tuesday morning, the Caroline County commissioners concluded that legal action might be necessary to get the state and the county to see eye-to-eye.\"I don't know if there's going to be any other avenue that we're going to go except to go to court,\" Caroline County Commissioner Vice President Larry Porter said. \"I think that's probably where we're going to end up.\"\nThese comments were made during a discussion on the Hobbs Road solar project, a 15-acre project proposed by Nexamp Solar LLC to put solar panels on a field that is no longer usable for farming. The commissioners approved a measure Tuesday that gives Nexamp the option to lease the land, which was formerly used as a landfill.\nBut the commissioners were clear that despite the approval of this project, their general stance on solar development in the area had not changed.\n\"We know there's been a lot of concern and conversation in the community about solar projects, and we want to make it clear that the Commissioners hear you,\" The Caroline County government stated in a Facebook post prior to the meeting.\n\"They do not want to see our county overrun with solar farms. However, they also have to follow state regulations that require a certain amount of land to be used for renewable energy production,\" the post said. \"By allowing this solar project on the Hobbs Road site, the Commissioners have actually preserved 15 acres of prime agricultural land that could have been used for this project instead.\"\nAfter the commissioner's vote, Porter addressed concerns voiced by residents in the comment section of the county's post.\n\"There's been a good amount of discussion on Facebook about our participation in this,\" Porter said. \"We've been called sell-outs and everything else because people for some reason think that we're in favor of this. I don't think there's just been any county that's fought harder against covering farmland with solar panels than Carolina County.\"\nTHE COUNTY'S STANCEThe county has a 2,000-acre moratorium for solar development in place, which is facing pressure as the state looks to expand solar energy use in the coming years to meet 100% clean energy goals by 2040.\nIn the past, the commissioners have voiced concerns that solar development threatens the area's rural nature and takes available land away from agricultural practices.\nPorter mentioned throughout the Tuesday meeting that farmers receive offers from solar companies in their mail weekly offering large sums of money to use their land to place solar panels.\n\"I think the dilemma that we find ourselves in, I know everyone has the right of the farmer to do with his land what he wants,\" Porter said. \"When someone comes in and says, 'we're going to make you this offer, and you have an opportunity to make money on your own land.' It's very difficult for us to sit up here and say, 'No, you can't.'\"\nSteve Kline, president and CEO of Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, attended the meeting on Tuesday and spoke with the commissioners on a plan that Talbot and Queen Anne's counties follow that he said could be beneficial to Caroline County.\n\"What ESLC encourages Caroline County to adopt is a per-acre mitigation fee,\" Kline said. \"... In Talbot, the mitigation fee is based on Maryland ag land preservation foundation fair market appraisal averages. In Queen Anne's County, the system assesses a half percent transfer tax on projects converting farmland to solar, and all of those funds are allocated for land preservation projects.\n\"... While both counties have adopted a different approach, both counties use substantially all of their fees on land conservation. The ESLC strongly believes the best way to protect agricultural land against all the threats it faces is permanent conservations like the ones we write,\" Kline said.\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) made a suggestion that all nine Eastern Shore counties fight together instead of separately to get communities on board with their plans to limit solar development. This, he said, will lend itself to a better outcome when it's time for legal action.\n\"Talbot County is going to host a meeting with all nine counties to talk about, and I think ahead of this meeting, we need to make sure that all nine counties are sharing whatever zoning laws that you all have already passed, and hopefully intend on enforcing. If there's some consistency with a lot of our zoning, as consistent we can possibly be, it's gonna be a lot easier to enforce it. It's gotta be a lot easier to message it to the public. And if you guys do it, it'll be easier to defend in court.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He saw smoke and started screaming for everyone to get out.\n\"I grabbed the baby and ran to call 911 and as I did that I seen flames under the camper,\" she recalled.\nDespite her boyfriend attempting to use a fire extinguisher, the flames already had caught the trees.\n\"It was out of control,\" she said.\nShe explained that Crumpton Volunteer Fire Department arrived fifteen minutes later after they discovered the fire.\nThe fire was reported shortly after 4 a.m. Crumpton Fire Department was the primary responding agency, with a total of 24 firefighters on-scene.\nOnce there, it took the fire department 30 minutes to control, but the damage was done. According to the fire marshal's report, a structure loss of $100,000, and loss of contents worth $20,000 was reported.\nThe marshal further stated that the area of origin of the blaze came from the underside of the camper due to an unspecified electrical failure.\nAs Markow awaits a visit from her pastor she'd appreciate any help from the community.\n\"We didn't have much to begin with,\" she said. \"So losing what we did put us in a deep hole.\"\nShe said the family is still trying to process this turn of events and are in shock. As a precautionary measure, they took the baby to the hospital to be evaluated.\nOn the Duck Neck Campground Facebook page, there's a call to action to help them.\nThe family are in need of clothes, shoes, diapers and any other necessities.\nWoman small, girl child size 10, toddler size 4t, baby girl 3-6 months, pull-ups diapers size 5t. Flip flops are needed too. Shoe sizes: girls, 6-7, 3, 4, and 7 women.\n\"Let's come together as a community and help this family,\" the campground's post read.\nThe church backs them up too, being one of the first on the scene to support them. They are organizing a clothing drive and has put up the funds to help them stay in a hotel for several days.\nIf anyone wants to help the family, the pastor for Grace Apostolic Church can be contacted at dtrombley@myantioch.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It will begin to welcome new residents this weekend.\nThe project, which sits right off of Matthewstown Road, was led by Mallard Construction Group.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook, Ward 2 Councilmember Robert Rankin and other town officials toured the apartments on Wednesday, getting a look at the first of four buildings at the site.\nJim DiDonato, president of Mallard Construction Group, thanked town officials and his team for making the project possible.\n\"We're glad that we can deliver a product that I think the town can be really happy with,\" DiDonato said.\nUnits include one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Amenities offered are a bike storage room, pickleball court, dog wash station, patio and more. The one-bedroom units start at just under $1,800 a month, while larger apartments range from $2,000 to $2,300, according to the complex's website.\nStephen Margerum, principal with Cove Property Management, said five people will move in this weekend, which will kick off a \"consistent flow of move-ins\" through November.\n\"We have a lot of demand, a lot of people wanting to move in as quickly as possible,\" Margerum said. \"The response from the prospective residents have been really great.\"\nHe said the two 38-unit buildings will be filled out by the end of the year. The other two buildings, both 30 units and still under construction, will be delivered next spring, Margerum said.\nProperty management has been busy with tours and applications, he said. Before the leasing office was set up, more than 400 people signed up or went into the The Promenade's applicant database, Margerum said.\nThe Elliott Road project is one of Easton's larger housing developments, by units, currently in the pipeline. More than 1,000 units have recently opened, are under construction or have received town approval.\nEarlier this month, developers for a downtown apartment complex on Brookletts Avenue cut the ribbon on a new leasing office. Construction on that 116-unit project begins later this fall. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "On the ballot: What is Question 1 or the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment?\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Reproductive healthcare access is up for vote in Maryland. Voters will have the chance to decide state protections on abortion access and whether or not to codify it into the state constitution.During the 2023 General Assembly, state lawmakers passed an amendment that would enshrine the right to an abortion and \"reproductive freedom,\" in Maryland's constitution.\nThe United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June of 2022, with a 5-4 vote indicating there is no constitutional right to abortion. Since that summer, the topic of abortion has been a hot-button issue across the nation.\nStates have weighed establishing constitutional amendments declaring protection over the right to abortion, and constitutional amendments have been approved by voters in California, Vermont and Michigan.\nStates such as Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia have passed amendments declaring that the state's constitution does not secure or protect a person's right to abortion.\nCurrently, abortion is legal in Maryland until viability and abortion is legal after viability if the woman's life or health is endangered or there is a fetal anomaly.\nWhat is on the ballot?Question 1, or the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, would amend the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution to add a new section that guarantees a right to \"reproductive freedom.\" According to the referendum, the term \"reproductive freedom\" includes include \"the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue or end one's own pregnancy.\nIf the amendment is approved by voters, it would prohibit the constitutional right of abortion access from being denied or infringed unless there is a compelling state interest, which would need to be achieved using the least restrictive means.\nErin Bradley, board chair of Freedom in Reproductive Maryland, has been advocating for passing the referendum.\n\"What this legislation does is it protects (abortion) at the highest level possible,\" Bradley said during an event in August. \"It's very easy to change statutes in any state's constitutional amendments. As you see, I need all of you here to go vote for it. So we would need to do that every time we try to change the constitution. So this is the highest legal protection we can offer in the state of Maryland.\"\nThe referendum is endorsed by Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland State Education Association and Pro-Choice Maryland.\nOpponents of the referendum include the Maryland Catholic Conference, Maryland Right to Life PAC and Maryland Family Institute.\nFrank Arlinghause, a Maryland doctor opposing the referendum, described the then Maryland Senate bill as \"extreme.\"\n\"Amending the Maryland Constitution is an unusual and extreme measure, and this bill would take an extreme position on abortion, restricting the legislature's opportunities to pass reasonable restrictions on abortion in late pregnancy or to restrict it as other healthcare,\" Arlinghause said.\nUnderstanding Question 1:The amendment was introduced as Senate Bill 798 on Feb. 6, 2023 and was passed by the Maryland Senate with a 32-15 vote. On March 30 of that year, the Maryland House passed the bill by a 98-38 vote, with three absent or no voting.\nA yes vote supports adding a new article to the Maryland Constitution's Declaration of Rights establishing a right to reproductive freedom, defined to include \"the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one's own pregnancy.\"\nA \"no\" vote opposes amending the state constitution to establish a right to reproductive freedom.\nEarly voting locations will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. until October 31. Election day is Tuesday November 5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

James Lawson Jr., an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutal reactions from white authorities as the Civil Rights Movement gained traction, has died, his family said Monday. He was 95.His family said Lawson died on Sunday after a short illness in Los Angeles, where he spent decades working as a pastor, labor movement organizer and university professor.\nLawson was a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who called him \"the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.\"\nLawson met King in 1957, after spending three years in India soaking up knowledge about Mohandas K. Gandhi's independence movement. King would travel to India himself two years later, but at the time, he had only read about Gandhi in books.\nThe two Black pastors — both 28 years old — quickly bonded over their enthusiasm for the Indian leader's ideas, and King urged Lawson to put them into action in the American South.\nLawson soon led workshops in church basements in Nashville, Tennessee, that prepared John Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, the Freedom Riders and many others to peacefully withstand vicious responses to their challenges of racist laws and policies.\nLawson's lessons led Nashville to become the first major city in the South to desegregate its downtown, on May 10, 1960, after hundreds of well-organized students staged lunch-counter sit-ins and boycotts of discriminatory businesses.\nLawson's particular contribution was to introduce Gandhian principles to people more familiar with biblical teachings, showing how direct action could expose the immorality and fragility of racist white power structures.\nGandhi said \"that we persons have the power to resist the racism in our own lives and souls,\" Lawson told the AP. \"We have the power to make choices and to say no to that wrong. That's also Jesus.\"\nYears later, in 1968, it was Lawson who organized the sanitation workers strike that fatefully drew King to Memphis. Lawson said he was at first paralyzed and forever saddened by King's assassination.\n\"I thought I would not live beyond 40, myself,\" Lawson said. \"The imminence of death was a part of the discipline we lived with, but no one as much as King.\"\nStill, Lawson made it his life's mission to preach the power of nonviolent direct action.\n\"I'm still anxious and frustrated,\" Lawson said as he marked the 50th anniversary of King's death with a march in Memphis. \"The task is unfinished.\"\nCivil rights activist Diane Nash was a 21-year-old college student when she began attending Lawson's Nashville workshops, which she called life-changing.\n\"His passing constitutes a very great loss,\" Nash said. \"He bears, I think, more responsibility than any other single person for the civil rights movement of Blacks being nonviolent in this country.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He later pleaded guilty to five of those counts.\nNow that the mayoral term — which he started but did not finish — is ending, Bradshaw is running for mayor again in the city's Oct. 19 election.\nMayoral candidate and Cambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas has also faced legal issues. In 2022, she was charged with second-degree assault in connection with a domestic violence incident in her Cambridge home. The charges were dismissed in January 2023.\nDuring the forum, mayoral candidate La-Shon Banks-Foster, who is running against Bradshaw and Cephas, said the answer to whether a criminal record should disqualify someone from being on the City Council is not a yes or no question. She said it depends on the crime, whether that person has been rehabilitated and what steps they've taken since.\nCephas said the question should be up to the voters. She added that one of a mayor's responsibilities is to meet with different people.\n\"Are they going to feel comfortable being in a photograph with someone that's known for a nation-wide headline that was, not only embarrassing to that person, but the victim and also that community that person represented?\" she said.\nBradshaw said he felt the question was directed toward him. He said that in a city where many people have made mistakes, a large portion of the population shouldn't be disqualified from serving on the City Council because of the \"errors of their past.\"\n\"And likewise, when people have overcome the failures that they've made, when they can move forward in their lives, we shouldn't turn away from the people that have talent and ability to contribute to a community,\" he said.\nIn response to Cephas' comments, Bradshaw said his convictions were withdrawn and removed by the state and his probation has been abated.\nAccording to court documents, in November 2023, Judge Thomas G. Ross ordered that the judgements of guilt for Bradshaw's five counts of distributing revenge porn be stricken and Bradshaw be granted probation before judgement.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat on Oct. 8, Bradshaw said he didn't want to go into detail on how this came about, but it was a decision made by his attorneys, the Office of the state Prosecutor and Ross.\nA court document filed in June said Bradshaw's probation abatement date — the end to active supervision of the defendant — was May 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Using the archetype of the traveler, who is seen holding suitcases and voyaging through a wide array of landscapes towards a better place, Corona tackles the reality of the human aspect of climate change while celebrating the lushness and vibrancy of flora, bodies of water, and geographic forms, and bringing attention to the multitudinous powers of nature,\" according to AAM's summary of the exhibit.\"The artist transformed the Museum's Saul Atrium Gallery with site-specific vignettes that each picture a character journeying from a land made uninhabitable by global warming. The immersive, large-scale installation also features Corona's Climate Ponchos, which double as wearable sculptures: while their form recalls a simple rain poncho, the dynamic patterns on them tell stories of migration and history.\" AAM's 2022-2023 Atrium Commission is supported by Donna and Jim Alpi, Carol Gordean, Joseph and Alzbetka Robillard, and Mary Ann Schindler.The atrium exhibit programs started in 2021.Corona is a Baltimore-based artists whose work is and has been featured at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Kreeger Museum, Peale Museum, and the Walters Art Museum.Corona's AAM exhibit is entitled \"Terrestrial Caravan\".For more: https://academyartmuseum.org/hoesycorona/ \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The next couple of weeks will either confirm that Joe is the candidate, or another Democrat will rise to the occasion and take on Trump.While the top of the ticket is of immense importance, equally important are the priorities of the party. That is, no matter who the Democratic nominee is, there are certain principles and policies that are more likely to advance and be preserved if Democrats are elected.\nBelow is one person's Top 10 list of reasons why it is imperative to support the eventual Democratic nominee, whomever that may be, as well as Democratic candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe Democrats will ...\nDeal with the climate challenges that are impacting our world by supporting clean energy and a phased reduction in fossil fuels.Recognize women's health care as a matter for a woman's conscience, her family, her doctor and her God, not nameless, faceless legislators.Be clear eyed about the existential threats that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran present to the free world.Continue to support our allies particularly Israel and Ukraine through our actions, not blustery promises.Know how important it is to appoint ethical justices to the Supreme Court that best reflect our nation's values so as to not allow further degradations to voting rights, health care options, gun control and climate protections.Continue economic policies that have pushed unemployment to historically low levels, jobs to new heights, spurred growth and managed an economy that continues to be the envy of the world.Be vigilant about future pandemics and rely on science and not conspiracy theories as how to best deal with them. Thousands of people died unnecessarily by a failure to have competent presidential leadership during COVID.Respect the results of elections.Not constantly lie to the American people.Not have four times indicted, twice impeached, convicted felon and serial liar running for commander in chief.\nThe choices are clear for November – support the Democratic nominee for president along with the Democratic ticket.

The two-day festival culminates with the Junior All Shore and Senior All Shore bands.\nOne student stood out for further distinction. John Schwaninger auditioned in the fall for the Maryland Music Educators Association All State Band Festival. He auditioned with students from high schools all over the state and was selected to perform with the Maryland All State Band on trombone. The Senior All State concert will be held on Feb. 25.\n\"I have been playing the trombone about nine years. There is a lot of hard work and practicing for it, said Schwaninger. \"I tried out the first year of middle school, so it is just a lot of practicing. I hope to play in college.

But the seventh-seeded Warriors committed four turnovers during last Friday night's season-ending 42-7 loss to second-seeded Milford Mill in a Class 2A state quarterfinal.\n\"If we could have thrown the ball like we normally do, I think it's a little different,\" Easton head coach Matt Griffith said of a game that at one point was 13-7 in the first half. \"I still think they beat us, but I think it's probably 42-21, 35-21, something like that.\n\"They're good,\" Griffith added of the Millers (10-1), who advance to Friday's semifinals, where they will host No. 3 seed Huntingtown (9-2). \"They've got some good players.\"\nBut in a season that started with Easton being ranked 10th in one preseason poll, the Warriors showed they too had some good players.\n\"We had a tremendous year,\" said Griffith, whose team was one of only three Bayside Conference teams still playing last Friday along with defending Class 2A state champion Stephen Decatur and Cambridge-South Dorchester, the overall No. 1 seed in Class 1A whose undefeated season also ended in the rain and wind.\nThere have been other Easton teams that posted better records.\nBut over the past 40 years, no Warriors team had ever won two playoff games in the same season. Perhaps more impressive is no Easton team over that same time frame enjoyed a greater turnaround from one season to the next.\nThe Warriors lost starting quarterback Mikey O'Connor in Week 2 of the 2023 season and struggled to a 1-8 finish. O'Connor returned this season and helped Easton to an 8-4 record. The closest any previous Warrior team came to that seven-win improvement was in 1979, when Easton finished 9-1 after a 3-7 slate the previous year.\n\"We had a good year,\" said Griffith, who finished with his highest win total in his 10 years as Easton's head coach, and earned his 50th career win with the Warriors' 28-21 victory over Kent Island in the second round of the 2A East Regional playoffs. \"The kids bought into the process in the offseason, which I think made a big difference, including Mikey. Mikey put on 15, 20 pounds and I think that was the difference in him being able to do what he did this year versus not being able to finish the (previous) year.\"\nThough Easton's senior quarterback completed just 4 of his 14 attempts for 30 yards and an interception Friday, he rushed for 189 yards and a touchdown on a career-high 33 carries. O'Connor finished the season 127 for 242 through the air for 1,938 yards, 21 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. He also led the team in rushing, carrying 219 times for 1,436 yards and 19 touchdowns.\nThere were plenty of other parts to Easton's success this year.\nA fleet of receivers that included Chase Raab, Diontaye Copper, Zach Barnhart and brothers Colin and Carter Mooney took turns making big catches and plays week after week. There was also the emergence of junior running back Dustin Blue, who became a brute force inside and out, totaling 652 yards and seven touchdowns.\nThen there was an offensive line, that lost four starters from 2023 for various reasons. But together with sole returner Tymiere Thomas at right tackle, center TJ Truxon, guards Jack Chappell and freshman Brady Gilliece, and left tackle Xavier Stowers steadily developed and improved.\n\"Jack Chappell stepped up and started at right guard,\" Griffith said. \"He gives you everything he has every play. TJ Truxon played center and did a good job for us this year. We had an outstanding freshman in Brady Gilliece at left guard, who I think is going to be one helluva player over the next couple years. And then we had sophomore left tackle in Xavier Stowers. And every so often we'd mix in Jaden Prestwood to give some guys some breaks. But those five pretty much played iron man football on the offensive line all year long.\"\nSenior place-kicker Dominic Stanco also proved to a consistent weapon.\n\"He got better as the season went on and had a strong leg,\" Griffith said of Stanco. \"It's a shame this is the only year he played football and he's a senior.\"\nNot to be overshadowed was a defense that despite giving up its share of big plays, showed grit and delivered plenty of big stops and came up with timely takeaways. Jordan Horsey and Kyree Acree led the Warriors in tackles under the guidance of new defensive coordinator Al Waters. Thomas again proved an interior anchor up front, while Prestwood developed into a problem for opponents with his ability to play tackle, end and linebacker.\n\"Everything we tried to get out of them I think we got,\" Griffith said. \"They gave it to us. They should be proud of their accomplishments for sure. And hopefully this is a part about setting a standard moving forward of what we're trying to do. But I think we got all the juice out of this squeeze, and maybe even a little bit of pulp.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It will be awarded to Marshall's Professional Property Management out of Cambridge.\nThe company will perform maintenance on properties as directed by code officials, such as unkempt yards, grass cutting and brush and debris removal.\n\"Last year, unfortunately, we did not have a contract with anybody,\" Diem said Tuesday. \"It kind of fell through the cracks under the previous management. We're trying to rectify that situation.\"\nDiem added that the decision to go with Marshall's Professional Property Management was based on performance and reliability, not price.\n\"We've had others in the past that the response was slow or nonexistent,\" Diem said. \"And then the billing was slow, which, in turn, leads to slow effort on the town to get those invoices out.\"\nOf the three bids not chosen, Diem wrote to the council that two raised responsibility and responsiveness concerns despite cheaper rates. The third came from S&B Landscaping, which will serve as code enforcement's backup contractor if additional support is needed.\nThe council unanimously approved Diem's request.\n\"I have had personal experience with them in my previous career, and they've been outstanding,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said of Marshall's. \"So I'm all in.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lessons learned from Donald Trump’s campaigns\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 797\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After every presidential election cycle, political pundits do a deep dive analysis on campaign strategies that were effective before the campaign launch and during the campaign.One of the most insightful and thought provoking analyses I have seen was written by Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin, published in the New York Times the day after the election.\nIn their article — \"Master of the Media Evolved Yet Again\" — Grynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"In his improbable journey to the apex of American power, President-elect Donald J. Trump has always adapted to the media tool of the moment.\"\nFormer president of CBS News, Andrew Heyward, echoes that conclusion: \"He's always looking to the next venue that's best suited to his instincts for generating support. It's part of Trump's extraordinary record of instinctively finding ways to viscerally connect with voters. He's a master of evolving media.\"\nThese observations are not a surprise based on reviewing Trump's career before his running for the presidency three times.\nWell before he ran for president the first time in 2016, Trump generated substantial name recognition in New York City and beyond with regular coverage in the New York Post. The Post, a daily tabloid newspaper, has the fourth-largest circulation of a printed newspaper in America. Its readership goes well beyond New York with a subscription-based online version.\nIn 2004, Trump recognized and seized an opportunity for even greater public exposure as the co producer and host of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\"\nDuring a long run on NBC TV, Trump worked hard to be viewed as a successful and decisive business mogul, willing to dismiss apprentice contestants with a memorable \"you're fired.\"\nThe result of that name recognition together with his \"take charge\" personality, was a key element in Trump defeating a large field of candidates in the 2016 Republican presidential primary elections. That led to a widely unexpected Electoral College win in November 2024.\nGrynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"Trump recognized the power of Twitter long before other politicians, and in 2016, he started doing cable news interviews.\"\nThey also wrote that he bypassed traditional media gatekeepers like \"60 Minutes\" on CBS, in favor of select online celebrities and podcasts that were especially popular among young men.\nAs an example, Grynbaum and Koblin noted that \"Bryson DeChambeau, a two-time U.S. Open golfing champion and YouTube star, did a video with Trump that had almost 13 million views.\"\nMore important than the always critical role of positive name recognition in any election, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested that bypassing the mainstream media allowed Trump to avoid confrontational interviews where he might have faced tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates.\nBy contrast, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested the carefully selected influencers Trump met rarely challenged him and often lavished him with praise.\nThe political wisdom of that strategy was affirmed in the one debate hosted by ABC news. Donald Trump did not do as well as expected, and Kamala Harris did better than expected.\nFollowing that debate, Trump declined to participate in a second debate and also pulled out of a planned interview with 60 Minutes. His decision not to appear was the first time since the late 1960s, when the program did not include host the two major-party presidential candidates.\nTrump's ignoring 60 Minutes was one of many based on his lack of trust in and disdain for many traditional legacy media outlets that he believed were left of center and hostile to him.\nDespite the risk of a negative voter reaction to his positions on the traditional media outlets, Trump assumed correctly that it would energize and mobilize his base if he regularly ignored and aggressively criticized the media, especially the legacy media.\nEven before that decision on 60 Minutes was made, Trump was showing up on podcasts, widely viewed as unconventional and even odd in the context of a presidential campaign.\nHis first podcast with online star and wrestler Logan Paul met that profile. Trump and Paul discussed boxing, immigration and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life.\nSome may say this commentary is all about Trump. I agree. The reasons are simple.\nDonald Trump has been elected president twice. This commentary includes my thoughts and thoughts of others on how the role of effective communication strategies contributed to those outcomes.\nKamala Harris has not yet been elected president and maybe never will be. In any event, I expect to do another commentary that will include my thoughts and the thoughts of others on how flawed communication strategies contributed to her loss in 2024.\nFor now, campaign communications strategies covered in this commentary, may or may not be relevant in upcoming elections in 2026, 2028 and beyond.\nThat said, I suggest there is one timeless lesson for all political candidates going forward. That lesson is: never fail to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of and use best practice in campaign communications strategies, especially those that are emerging. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year's production of \"Sister Act\" takes the cake. Director Richard Vitanovec has done it again.From lead singer junior Ta'Vea Roberts to freshman Mother Superior Kira Callis, the talent is superb. There is Broadway material on that stage!\nThe set designs incorporated some digital background scenery which was captivating. The get-a-way running scenes were entertaining.\nAs Mr. Vitanovec wrote in his Director's thoughts, \"Love, comfort and acceptance are something that we all need in our lives right now.\"\nPlease support these amazing students and adults who have produced a thoroughly enjoyable show.\nGo see \"Sister Act\" at EHS on March 28, 29 &30.\nSUSAN CLAGGETT\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It won't be favorable in some of these areas,\" said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist for AccuWeather.\nBuckingham said parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — which are attracting scores of eclipse viewers because of their propensity for clearer skies — might see clouds and storms during the eclipse.\nAreas of northern Ohio in the eclipse path are also expecting surges of visitors. They could also see some cloudy conditions.\n\"It's kind of a blend of clouds and sun,\" said Buckingham of the Monday forecast for northern Ohio.\nStill, the eclipse could be visible through cloudy conditions depending on the types of clouds as well as their prevalence and depth.\nThe weather dynamics would send eclipse tourists and the scores of astronomers and researchers driving to destinations with clearer skies. That could add to the already expected traffic congestion dynamics expected on Monday.\nBuckingham, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, plans on driving to view the eclipse. He's still figuring out the best place to view the solar eclipse in its totality.\n\"It's one of those game-time decisions,\" he said.\nBEST PLACES TO VIEW\nMarc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the eclipse forecast is still developing. There's a cold front moving eastward across the U.S. and storms and clouds being fostered in the Gulf of Mexico that will head west.\n\"Right now, it's still a bit uncertain,\" Chenard said, of where, when and how many clouds might be in the skies during the afternoon eclipse.\nHe said the most clear areas to view the eclipse in the totality path could be in northern parts of Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois and southern Indiana.\nHe said parts of New England and Canada could also be clear, but the eclipse viewing in places such as Ohio could depend on the amount and depth of cloud cover.\nMid-Atlantic areas could see a mix bag for viewing with partly cloudy conditions forecasted for Easton, Ocean City and other parts of the Eastern Shore for Monday — the day of the eclipse.\nChenard said areas in Texas could also be \"a game-time decision\" in terms of eclipse visibility with clear skies expected in western areas of the state and more cloudy weather and storms to the east.\n\"It really could go either way,\" said Chenard, who will be visiting Texas for the eclipse.\nIn other parts of the U.S, the moon will partially block out the sun Monday afternoon.\nBuckingham said Southern California as well as central parts of the state and the Southwest could have good viewing weather while parts of the Mountain West (including Montana and Wyoming) and upper Midwest could see overcast conditions.\nGulf coast areas of Louisiana and Mississippi could see rain and clouds while the big cities of east coast such as New York, Boston and Washington D.C. could see some clouds generally decent eclipse viewing weather\nChenard said the Central Plains, Texas and Oklahoma panhandles along with Georgia and Florida can expect clear skies for the celestial event.\n\"The Southeast looks pretty good,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What goes into class lists, and transportation and cleaning the building, new teachers. I am proud to say that we are fully staffed, all certified positions. There are 189 people on staff.\"\nShe added enthusiasm to the effort.\n\"I am so excited and energized. This is why we do what we do to see these sweet little faces coming through our building every day. It is a happy day,\" Devaric said.\nSuperintendent of Talbot County Schools Sharon Pepukayi had a welcome sign and was waving to families as they arrived.\n\"Our theme this year is transforming and performing together. After two years, going into my third, we realized we are better together,\" Pepukayi said, referring to the amount of time she has served as superintendent.\nGetting ready does not start on the first day of school, she said.\n\"We have been working hard this summer with a lot of professional development we put it in place based on feedback we have received from staff but also internal data,\" Pepukayi said.\nThese efforts included training and preparations to accommodate multilingual learners.\n\"The school district is not an isolated entity. The whole community comes together for our families. I want the kids to walk in feeling confident, walking in with a sense of belonging, that they can use their voice to ask for what they need instead of being afraid,\" she said.\nAmy Dodson, the Talbot County Board of Education School Board member for District 3, dropped off her three kids at Easton Elementary Monday morning.\n\"As a mom you are always a little anxious the first day, but they are in great hands,\" she said. \"The took off.

    "content": "ON THE REBOUND\n\n September 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 834\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — If.That's how Matt Griffith started his preseason commentary entering his 10th year as Easton High's head football coach.\nGriffith's first word is certainly understandable considering starting quarterback Mikey O'Connor suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2 of last year, which played a huge role in the Warriors going 1-8.\n\"If we can healthy, 'cause we got low numbers, and continue to improve we should be able to put a good product out on the field,\" said Griffith, who also lost his starting quarterback, Mason Ledford, in Week 2 of the 2017 season.\nA 6-foot-3, 195-pound senior, the left-handed throwing O'Connor returns as the starter behind center, and is backed by 6-3, 220-pound sophomore Brady Walls, a transfer from St. Mary's.\n\"Mikey looks really good,\" said Griffith, of the third O'Connor brother to start at quarterback for the Warriors. \"The transfer kid (Walls) is pretty good, too.\"\nEaston's backfield not only looks pretty good, but appears plenty deep. Junior Dustin Blue (5-11, 212) and sophomore Jordan Horsey form a nice, physical one-two punch. Freshman Jamier Copper (5-9, 195), juniors JaSere Molina (5-7, 160) and Tayshaun Roberts (5-8, 180), and senior Najhay Smith (5-9, 175) are also expected to get rotated into the ground game.\n\"Really deep at running back,\" Griffith said. \"We've got five kids that I think we can hand the ball off to and we're not missing much of anything. The first two are bruisers with Dustin and Jordan. They're a load to tackle. And JaSere gives us a nice change of pace with a different type speed. He's pretty quick.\"\nQuickness is also found in a receiving corps that welcomes the return of senior standout Chase Raab (5-11, 180), who never got on the field a year ago after an injury in 7-on-7 summer play wiped out his entire season.\n\"That's a big, big lift for us, getting him back,\" Griffith said of Raab. \"And he's 100 percent, which is good.\"\nThe rest of the receiving cast doesn't look too shabby either, with junior wideouts Carter Mooney (5-11, 180) and Logan Friend (5-10, 160), and seniors Jaden Prestwood (6-3, 215) and Finn Gunshenan (5-10, 170). The Warriors' biggest threats though may be at slot. Senior Colin Mooney (5-7, 170) returns and is joined by juniors Diontaye Copper (5-10, 185), Kyree Acree (5-11, 175) and Zach Barnhart (5-8, 180).\n\"We have a good core that we can cycle through and get breaks on offense, and not have any drop-offs because some of these guys are going to be playing on the defensive side of the ball as well,\" Griffith said. \"It's going to be nice to be able to go, 'Kyree you're going in for Diontaye, and Zach,' and vice versa to be able to get them some breaks.\"\nEaston lost four starters from the offensive line, with junior right tackle Tymiere Thomas (5-10, 240) the lone returner. But Griffith has liked his young group's development and praised the work of assistants Drew Griffith — his son — and Dave Perillo, the longtime line coach at Queen Anne's County.\nJunior Trushun Truxon Jr. (5-11, 190) starts at center, with freshman guard Brady Gilliece (6-3, 225) and sophomore tackle Xavier Stowers (6-3, 230) lining up on his left, and junior guard Jack Chapple (6-4, 220) joining Thomas on the right side. Senior Nathaniel Lapp (6-7, 225) and juniors Paul Whitlock (5-10, 210) and Tracey Gore (6-0, 285) could also be moved in and out of the lineup.\n\"Young. Inexperienced. But a very good work in progress,\" Griffith said of his offensive front. \"They're improving every day. It's good sized and most of those kids spent time in the weight room.\"\nThe defense has many of the same faces, with a few different ones sprinkled through.\nSophomore Elias Leonard (5-10, 305) is at nose guard, where Groce and Truxon could also get time. Thomas is back at one tackle and has looked great in the preseason, according to his head coach. Teaming with him up front will be a rotation of Stowers, Lapp, Gilliece, Whitlock and Chapple.\nInside linebacker should be a strength, with Blue and Horsey starting, and Copper, Gunshenan and junior Alex Rhodes (5-10, 180) in reserve. Prestwood and Roberts start outside, but Griffith noted sophomores Nevin Whitaker (5-9, 190) and Teddy Antal (6-0, 175) could see time.\nThe secondary is athletic and fast, with Acree, Copper, Friend, Molina and Carter Mooney at the corners. Raab starts at free safety, while Colin Mooney and Barnhart are at strong safety.\n\"They're learning the new system under coach (Al) Waters,\" Griffith said of his new defensive coordinator, who has coached at Queen Anne's and Cambridge-South Dorchester. \"They're enjoying it. It's not a lot different from what we're used to. We're starting to do less thinking and play a little faster.\"\nSenior Dominic Stanco, who also plays soccer, handles the place-kicking chores. Horsey and Walls will punt.\n\"Very excited to see how they continue to improve,\" Griffith said of his team.\nEaston opens Friday when its hosts North East of Cecil County, coached by Warrior alum Taylor Slaughenhoupt. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Eagles' offensive coordinator Moore becomes New Orleans head coach\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEW ORLEANS — Kellen Moore, who oversaw the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles ' offense this season, has agreed to return to the site of his latest triumph as the next coach of the New Orleans Saints.The 36-year-old Moore will join an organization that has been floundering since the retirement of quarterback Drew Brees and departure of Super Bowl-winning coach Sean Payton. The Saints haven't made the playoffs since the 2020 season — the last of Brees' career.\nTheir interest in Moore became increasingly evident as the club waited longer to fill its vacancy than any other NFL team seeking a new coach this year.\nMoore was the only assistant coach on either Super Bowl team to be interviewed by New Orleans and thus the only candidate who, under league rules, could not be hired until after Sunday's title game was played. The Saints announced their agreement with Moore on Tuesday.\nTheir decision mirrors that of several teams that have found success after hiring relatively young offensive coaches. They included the Los Angeles Rams with Sean McVay, Green Bay with Matt LaFleur, Miami with Mike McDaniel and Minnesota with 2024 AP Coach of the Year Kevin O'Connell. All four of those coaches were hired while in their 30s.\nA standout college quarterback at Boise State, Moore had a six-year career as a practice squad or reserve QB with Detroit (2012-2014) and Dallas (2015-2017). He played in just three regular-season games, all with the Cowboys in 2015.\nHe moved into coaching in 2018 as a quarterbacks coach and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2019. He left Dallas to join the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023 before moving to Philadelphia in 2024.\nWhile Moore tended to favor pass-heavy schemes in his early years as a coordinator, he adapted when he joined the Eagles.\nRecognizing Philadelphia's strength as a running team — with its big, physical offensive line, star running back Saquon Barkley and mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts — Moore oversaw the NFL's second-ranked ground game in 2024.\nThe Eagles rushed for a franchise-record 3,048 yards, with Barkley gaining 2,005 of that before adding an additional 499 yards in four playoff games. And when the Chiefs limited Barkley to 57 yards rushing in the Super Bowl, Moore responded with well-timed passing plays that included touchdowns of 46 yards to DeVonta Smith and 12 yards to A.J. Brown.\nMoore takes over an offense featuring versatile running back Alvin Kamara and receiver Chris Olave.\nWhile in New Orleans for the Super Bowl this past week, Moore discussed how he tries feature the strengths of available personnel in his play-calling.\n\"You have certain things that you have strong feelings about from a coaching perspective — certain philosophies — but I think it's important to do what your players do best,\" Moore said. \"Going from Dallas to LA to Philadelphia, we've certainly played three different styles, and it's fun when you team up with people just building it however we want to.\"\nSaints quarterback Derek Carr has two years left on his contract, but his future with the Saints is cloudy following a pair of non-playoff seasons with the club.\nMoore will become the Saints' second head coach since Payton briefly retired following the 2021 season, during which New Orleans went 9-7 and narrowly missed the playoffs.\nThat was the first of what is now four straight seasons without a playoff berth.\nPayton's former defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen, took over in 2021, only to go 18-25 during 2 1/2 seasons before being fired following a seven-game skid.\nDarren Rizzi, who was a special teams coordinator under both Payton and Allen, took over on an interim basis and went 3-5.\nHe wanted to remain with the Saints and interviewed for the full-time job after this season. New Orleans also interviewed Miami Dolphins coordinator Anthony Weaver, New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Detroit defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady.\nFormer Dallas and Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy also was expected to interview with New Orleans but withdrew his candidacy on Jan. 28, just days after Brady withdrew. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cow chip toss defining moment for reporter\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1056\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL — I never gave a crap about cow chip tosses until I competed in one at the Cecil County Fair on Sunday evening.My editor assigned me the story. And it was consistent with the other George-Plimpton-style assignments he had doled out to me for our fair (the event, not the quality of work) coverage in the past.\nHe is the reason why I plunged my face into a miniature peach cobbler topped with a cumulus cloud of whipped cream during the annual pie-eating contest two years ago, as one example.\nThe contest is simple. Contestants competing by gender and in various age brackets attempt to toss a \"cow chip\" into a metal bucket, which is about 15 feet away. Those who sink the cow chip advance to Round 2, when the toss-line is moved back to approximately 20 feet away from the target, and those who miss are eliminated.\nThis process is repeated until every competitor is sidelined except for the most accurate tosser, who smiles moments later as a fair representative presents him or her with the 1st Place Ribbon.\nThen, that elated cow-chip-toss winner looks straight into the lens and gushes, \"I'm going to Disney World,\" after the off-camera reporter asks what will be the champion's next conquest . . . OK, OK, I made up that last part.\nBefore I continue with my slightly embellished account, it's important to clear up some misleading cow-chip-toss terms, the first of which is the term \"cow chip.\" For the record, I and my fellow contestants did not toss cow chips.\nInstead, we tossed clay pigeons, the kind that hunters use for target practice. Those clay pigeons are normally propelled high into the air by a machine or by a guy with a really, really strong throwing arm to simulate the flight of pheasants, geese, ducks and other winged prey and hunters shoot them down with their shotguns.\nI hate to quibble, but the clay pigeons we tossed Sunday evening looked nothing like pigeons — or any other type of bird, reptile or mammal, including humans. What we cow-chip-toss gladiators tossed were orangey, palm-sized discs.\nFurthermore, I feel compelled to be a stickler about this: clay pigeons aren't made of clay, but they actually are comprised of limestone and petroleum pitch — based on my extensive AI and Wikipedia research . . . Yeah, it's starting to dawn on me now that I don't hate to quibble after all.\nSo why is the contest called a cow chip toss?\nWell, this is where it gets repulsively interesting. It seems that, up until an estimated two decades ago, according to some unofficial Cecil County Fair historians, cow chip toss competitors tossed actual cow chips.\nWhat is a cow chip, some may ask. Sure, I'll field this one. A cow chip is manure that has been dropped in a field by — you guessed it, a cow — and then has been dried out by the sun into a hardened, disc-like shape.\nIt should not be confused with the terms \"cow patties\" or \"cow pies,\" however, if I'm comprehending my AI/Wikipedia research information correctly.\nCow patties and cow pies are fresh (Oxymoron Alert), wet cow dung, before they've been petrified by the sun. Speaking of petrified, the AI Overview included a photo of a fresh, wet cow patty and it scared me to death. Some things in life you truly cannot unsee.\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, petrified cow crap and how it was once used in the cow chip toss contests.\nI assumed, naturally, that Cecil County Fair officials overseeing the cow chip toss competition 20-some years ago pooh-pooh'ed the practice of using real dry dung discs and replaced them with clay pigeons — or discs masquerading as clay and as pigeons — because it would be more sanitary.\nBut that is not the reason, according to local farmer and fellow contestant Mark Crouse, who chatted with me Sunday evening during the competition. He explained that fair planners in the Cow Chip Toss Department opted for clay pigeons (ahem) at some point because of a supply-and-demand problem encountered when doing things the organic, old-fashioned way.\nTurns out, Crouse, who is 48, traipsed through the fields on the Miller Family dairy farm near North East when he was a teenager and gathered cow chips for the annual fair contest. Al Miller, who has served on the Cecil County Fair Board for 47 years, also served on that cow chip collection crew.\n\"It's harder to collect suitable cow chips than you would think,\" Crouse emphasized.\nThen Crouse outlined, \"The cow had to go in the pasture. You couldn't have rain the day before or even two days before, either, because it had to be completely dried out. You hope it's dry before you pick it up, but that isn't always the case.\"\nIt's noteworthy here that, according to my AI research, a fresh cow patty consists of approximately 83 percent water. Yes, it actually cited \"about\" 83 percent. I'm assuming a more precise cow-manure-moisture reading would involve a decimal point followed by lots more numbers, all of which compiled by scientists in white lab coats and buoyed by government grants.\nMiller further explained that changes in the dairy farming field (no pun intended) created the supply problem. \"The cows used to go out in the pasture, but the cows are more confined now,\" Miller said, agreeing that the change leading to the paucity of perfect cow poo occurred about 20 to 30 years ago.\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, Sunday evening's cow chip toss contest and my participation in it.\nWell, we're running out of space now because, apparently, I digressed for quite a bit back there. So I'll finally cut to the chase. I competed in the class for men who are 26 and older and sunk my first \"cow chip.\" During Round 2, I missed slightly to the right of the bucket, with my clay pigeon crashing onto the ground and exploding into tiny pieces like it had been shot by a target-practicing hunter.\nAfter Round 3, which I watched from the sidelines, it was determined that I tied for 2nd Place. And I, quite surprised, received a ribbon indicating that feat.\nBut I must say this: Knowing that I could have been tossing real cow chips if that supply-and-demand problem hadn't happened, I left the fair Sunday evening feeling like I took home a 1st Place Ribbon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black watermen’s monument proposed for Wells Cove\n\n September 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The Queen Anne's County Commissioners approved Wells Cove as the site for a proposed Black watermen's monument Aug. 26, further representing the history and legacy of the county's iconic industry.Tilghman Hemsley, a Queenstown artist and director of American Patriotic Monuments Inc., who created the original Kent Narrows watermen's monument 20 years ago, said he had been approached about the lack of Black representation in that project.\nSeeking commissioner approval to establish the new monument on county property at Wells Cove, Hemsley presented mock-ups of the detailed sculptures.\nSymbolizing the rich heritage of Black watermen, the monument will depict life-size bronze sculptures featuring a conversation between a head boat captain and an oyster boat worker, according to Hemsley. The piece will also feature other important aspects of the industry, including a man working with clams, a woman picking crabs, another cleaning fish, as well as a young boy with a fishing pole along for the experience.\n\"It's a sculpture that leans into the whole industry,\" Hemsley said.\n\"The piece is designed for the public to be able to come through and be part of the sculpture,\" he said.\nWith the history of the Black watermen engraved into the side of the pieces, \"it's all about education,\" he said.\nThe monument is slated for a location between Bridges Restaurant and the Jetty restaurant. Hemsley emphasized the interactive nature of the work, allowing visitors the opportunity to pass between the pieces and engage with the sculptures as they visit the local area.\nThe watermen will be life-size bronze sculptures while the boat pieces will be stainless steel and powder-coated, he said.\nHemsley said the design of the pieces should make the monument low maintenance.\nThe project has already received approval from the Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation Department and a letter of recommendation from the Kent Narrows Foundation, he said.\nThe commissioners unanimously approved Wells Cove as the site for the proposed monument. Commissioner Jim Moran noted he would have preferred a competition among artists to design a tribute to Black watermen but supported the plan.\nHemsley noted time is of the essence if the statue is to be ready by July 4, 2026, in celebration of the country's 250th anniversary.\nServing as director of the project, Hemsley said various other artists will be involved in the sculpture work. The proposed monument has an advisory committee that includes watermen, he said.\nWith commissioner approval, the next steps include seeking funding grants, according to Hemsley.\nAlthough highly appreciated, just like the original watermen's monument, the project would not be solely dependent on county support, he said.\nThe total cost for the project is estimated at about $475,000. The previous watermen's monument cost about $300,000, he said.\nStatues typically take about three years to complete, but Hemsley was confident as long as funding came through.\n\"It's aggressive, but we can do it,\" he said.\nA fundraising event with auctions, games and music will be held at the Kent Island American Legion Nov. 8 starting at 7 p.m., he said.\nHemsley is also working with the Centreville Veterans Information Committee to create a life-size statue honoring the more than 400 Black soldiers of Queen Anne's County who fought for the Union during the Civil War.\nWorking with Chesapeake Charities, the veteran statue committee has been hard at work establishing itself as a nonprofit, according to John Wright, statue committee chair.\nWright credited the enthusiasm of the committee in working to establish a historic monument.\n\"I'm glad I am in a position to help,\" he said.\nWith the sculpture to be completed in stages, the committee foresees about a year and a half before a statue stands in front of the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center.\nDonations can be sent to United States Colored Troops Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 42, Centreville, MD 21617.\nAs a Maryland nonprofit, American Patriotic Monuments Inc. seeks to lead public arts projects and monuments that celebrate American legacies.\nMore information, including sponsorship opportunities, can be found at apmiart.org.\nInformation about Hemsley's work can be found at tilghmanhemsleyfinearts.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But there are moments when silence becomes complicity. This election was one of those moments.\nIn the race for Easton Town Council president, Don Abbatiello's victory is a rebuke of disturbing tactics. What should have been a thoughtful campaign about Easton's future devolved into a smear operation.\nResidents's mailboxes were flooded with campaign mailers riddled with distortions, personal attacks and fabricated attributions.\nThis wasn't a fluke. It's part of a broader pattern, including in the last mayoral race and in Talbot's last Board of Education election, where similar mis- and disinformation tactics were deployed.\nLet's be clear: This is not how we build trust in our institutions or inspire faith in local government.\nWe must recognize what this climate costs us. Running for office is hard. It takes courage, vulnerability and a willingness to serve.\nWhen elections are defined by deceit and personal destruction, we risk deterring good people from stepping forward. Toxic tactics don't just harm their intended targets — they corrode our civic culture and discourage participation at every level. Do we want to be a community where fewer of our neighbors are willing to put their name on the ballot?\nThat's why Don Abbatiello's candidacy — and his win — matter so deeply. He chose a different path. He ran a campaign grounded in service, not slander. He listened, engaged and refused to stoop to the politics of fear. His leadership style reflects the best of Easton: respectful, thoughtful, inclusive and committed to all residents — not just those aligned with one political view.\nIn electing Don, the people of Easton showed that they value honesty over artifice and unity over division. They showed that even when misinformation floods, truth still has the power to rise above it.\nLet's take heart in this result and the historic turnout for this election. It shows that voters are paying attention. It reminds us that integrity still wins. And it proves that voting matters.\nPHIL JACKSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — St. Michaels commissioners dove into the process of renewing the town's comprehensive plan with a workshop meeting on Tuesday.One of the main topics discussed was the town's priorities for the updated plan, which is revised every 10 years.\nWhile no firm decisions were made, the commissioners said existing passages in the current plan would be taken into consideration.\nCommissioners President Jay Hudson said there will be a special meeting schedule to discuss the commissioners priorities.\n\"We have been discussing getting together with a special session to discuss what those priorities are,\" Hudson said. \"As you know, we've just hired a new town manager as of April, and he's been busy getting himself acclimated to his role. Now it is time for us to sit down and kind of prioritize projects moving forward.\"\nHudson said that the commissioners would come back to the Nov. 5 comprehensive plan meeting with priorities mapped out. Hudson also mentioned that the priorities in already outlined in Chapter 14 of the comprehensive plan will be the road map.\nDuring the meeting, commissioners brought up multiple concerns and items they wished were included within the plan. Commissioner Alexis Roiter mentioned demographics as a consideration. Hudson said that the Planning Commission plans to add all of those to the plan before the next meeting.\n\"Those are easy ones. Looking at a 10 year plan, it's definitely necessary to see what the demographics are when we're writing it,\" Hudson said.\nWith federal funding in question, to make sure all of St. Michaels plan can be completed, the town plans to strengthen its relationship with Talbot County.\n\"I think all the municipalities in Talbot County have a wonderful working relationship with the county,\" Hudson said. \"I think now with grant funding running out and having a better idea of what we need moving forward, I think for us now it's imperative to strengthening the relationships with the county. It's more creating these programs so that these relationships can work.\"\nThe special meeting to discuss the commissioners' priorities for the comprehensive plan has not been scheduled yet, but the next comprehensive plan meeting will be Nov. 5 at 5 p.m. at 407 St. Mary's Square. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hot or not?: Trump touts U.S. economy but businesses are leery of what lies ahead\n\n August 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: Business \n \n 1108\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is the U.S. economy hot, cooling or somewhere in between?President Donald Trump and his acolytes say the U.S. economy is humming, citing rising stock markets, big promised corporate and foreign direct investments and lower gasoline prices.\n\"We have the hottest country on Earth. We have the hottest economy on Earth,\" Trump said earlier this month.\n\"We have hundreds of billions of dollars falling in from tariffs …One year ago we were dead as a door nail. Now, we have the hottest country,\" Trump continued.\nThe White House touts $8.7 trillion in announced or promised U.S. investments since Trump took office in January from corporate titans such as Apple, NVDIA and IBM as well as countries such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Qatar.\nTrump's always-vociferous critics counter that the cost of housing, child care and groceries are still high compared to before the resets of the coronavirus pandemic, and they worry about the president's very-malleable tariffs regime driving up prices and straining supply chains.\nSome economists and analysts see the potential for slower growth and hiring combined with higher prices from tariffs and post-pandemic inflation. Some employers are also looking to artificial intelligence and robotics to take over some workers' duties.\nA new forecast from Capital Economics released Aug. 25 foresees 690,000 new jobs created in the U.S. over the next 12 months, 64% less than the jobs created in 2024, according to reports by the Telegraph and Business Matters. That comes after major revisions trimmed recent government jobs growth numbers.\n'HOLDING PATTERN'In the middle and on the frontlines of the economy, some businesses loaded up on inventory and materials from China and other importers to help stave off some of the impacts of Trump's tariffs.\nOther business owners are in a wait-and-see mode for the impacts of the tariffs and other Trump economic policies with job growth slowing and wholesale prices coming in higher than expected in July.\n\"A lot of people are really in a holding pattern with spending,\" said Nathan Green, CEO of Next Level Radio. The Maryland-based company provides radio and music content to hotels, casinos and other venues in 29 U.S. states.\nGreen sees some more careful spending among both businesses and consumers.\n\"People are just not sure if the other shoe is going to drop,\" Green said.\nMelissa Katrincic, co-founder and CEO of Conniption Gin in Durham, North Carolina, has also been navigating the Trump landscape.\nThe downtown distillery sources its juniper berries for its gins from Albania and Bulgaria. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on Albania while Bulgaria is part of the European Union, which is currently subject to a 15% U.S. tariff rate under the most recent deal with Trump.\nKatrincic said her distillery gets its bottles and glassware from China.\n\"We source from China for a custom bottle design,\" she said. \"We over-purchased at the end of 2024 knowing there could be a lot of uncertainty.\"\nTrump kicked the can until November with trade negotiations with China. The current U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports is 30%. Trump's use of emergency powers to invoke some of his tariffs faces legal challenges.\nKatrincic is keeping tabs on tariffs as well as broader trends such as consumer spending, travel, inflation and social connections.\nShe is hoping to see a rebound in \"ritualistic pauses\" such as having a drink after work or before a special event, noting how those activities were lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTRAVEL TRENDSThe summer tourism season has seen a similarly mixed picture.\nDiane Medler, executive director of Discover Kalispell in Montana, saw a drop in tourism activity in the spring and early summer but was more optimistic about the rest of summer and into the fall. The Kalispell area is home to Glacier National Park and has other outdoor attractions.\n\"We do anticipate more road trippers throughout the summer and into fall,\" she said.\nMedler has seen a \"steep decline\" in Canadian tourists. Trump's tariffs and previous jabs of making Canada the 51st state have made him unpopular north of the border impacting tourism to the U.S.\nLike other tourism groups, the Montana organization has been putting an emphasis on attracting visitors from nearby markets.\nConsumers and businesses are still impacted by post-pandemic inflation.\nU.S. prices are up 26% from the end of 2019 and before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nU.S. households are carrying a record $18.39 trillion in debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\"We are placing a heavy emphasis on drive market traffic, specifically Montanans who are looking to explore closer to home, as well as Spokane and Seattle,\" Medler said.\nAnnette Brown, chief marketing officer at Visit Temecula Valley in California, said her group has seen continued healthy visitations from Canadians.\n\"For the remainder of this year, we've paused all international PR and marketing efforts, except for Canada, where we're still seeing demand that justifies continued investment,\" she said.\nBrown also sees more road trips.\n\"This year, driving vacations, or road trips, are a prominent trend. Many travelers are opting for road trips to have greater flexibility for exploration and to avoid the costs and potential hassles of air travel,\" she said.\n'PROCEED CAREFULLY'As of close of Thursday trading, U.S. stocks markets are up for the year with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 7%, the S&P 500 is up more than 10% and the Nasdaq is up more than 12%, according to Google Finance.\nStocks jumped Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the central bank was getting ready to cut interest rates.\nTrump has been pressuring Powell and the central bank to cut rates.\nPowell has been reticent to cut rates citing uncertainty about tariffs. On Friday, Powell indicated that sentiment is changing during remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the annual meeting of U.S. and global elites.\n\"The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\" Powell said.\nThe U.S. jobless rate is currently 4.2%. Gas prices stand at $3.16 per gallon on average nationally (as of Monday, Aug. 25), according to AAA Fuel Gauge Report. That is down from $3.35 per gallon a year ago and the record-high $5.02 per gallon set in 2022.\nWall Street reactively negatively to Trump's higher tariffs pushes but then rallied when the president eased the U.S. stance, retreated or \"taco-ed\" (Trump always chickens out) as part of negotiations, according to University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, a Trump critic.\n\"The stock market is not the economy, but if you listen carefully, the stock market can be informative, \" Wolfers said in a social media analysis. \"Every time Trump leans into his economic instincts — threatening tariffs, undermining the Fed, or destroying institutions, stocks tank. Every time he tacos, they bounce back.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Incumbent John Hurley and two others, Chad Leister and Lakia Harris-Pierce, will face off in a town-wide election Monday.Candidates spoke to issues currently impacting the town as reasons they decided to run.\nAll of the candidates are aware of an ongoing investigation by the Office of the State's Attorney into the Ridgley Police Department, which resulted in the entire department being suspended in March. The Sheriff's Office has taken over the duties of policing the town while the investigation takes place. Details of the investigation have not yet been made available to the public.\nOther big issues raised by candidates include giving the next generation a reason to stay in Ridgely and keeping the small-town character alive despite the town's growth.\nLAKIA HARRIS-PIERCE\"I am running because I have a vision of a vibrant and strong community moving forward for the next generation,\" said Harris-Pierce. \"That is a community that engages with each other. They are part of the decision making process with the leadership. They would also volunteer their time to upkeep the community.\"\nHarris-Pierce is a veteran and has a background in social work. She is the only Black candidate for the commissioner seat, which she said gives her perspective into the needs of Ridgely's Black community.\n\"When I am out in the world, I see that we are behind in education, infrastructure and technology,\" she said. \"These kids are going to grow up and leave here one day. The only (way) to bring them back is to keep it growing. There is nothing here for the next generation to come back to and build on.\"\nHarris-Pierce has a masters degree in cannabis studies. As a cannabis policy expert, she said she would work to change the town moratorium on cannabis businesses to attract these businesses to the town. \"It will bring in revenue, and it will bring in jobs,\" she said.\nFocusing on the suspension of the Ridgely Police Department, she said, \"Right now there is no solution because we would just have to wait for the investigation to be over.\"\n\"We haven't had any crime go up. The residents are all getting along. I think it comes down to trust and authenticity. The community is at a loss about what happened with our police department. Not just the police chief but the commissioners too, they hired those people,\" Harris-Pierce said.\nJOHN HURLEYHurley has been a Ridgely commissioner since 2012. He has lived on the Eastern Shore his entire life and has lived in Ridgely since 1987.\nIn an email to the Star Democrat, Hurley wrote, \"I love my small town and try to make our town better. In my 12 years as a Commissioner, the town has gone from a deficit to a surplus without raising taxes.\"\nHe touted his record of fiscal discipline.\n\"(It is) A small town with only so much money to go around- without raising taxes. Taxes have not been raised in the 12 years. I have been in office and I don't plan on raising them,\" Hurley wrote.\nHurley has a long history as a firefighter, having worked on the BWI Airport Fire Department for upwards of three decades. He is also a member of the Ridgely Volunteer Fire Department.\nHe wrote about the Ridgely Police department, \"It may be a year until the outcome of the investigation comes to a finish. Until that happens, there really can't be a solution.\"\nCHAD LEISTERLeister, an electrician, said he hopes, if elected, to provide fresh perspective to the Town Commissioners.\n\"A lot of people in town positions, they have been there for a decade or more and always run uncontested,\" he said. \"I don't think someone should be running uncontested for an office position like that.\"\nHe also had some fiscal concerns about the suspension of the Ridgely Police Department.\n\"We are paying our police department, which I understand because we don't know if they are guilty or innocent. It is innocent until proven guilty,\" Leister said. \"And then we are also paying to rent police officers from the Sheriff's Department. We have to know a solution soon. We can't be doing both. I think the State's Attorney that is in charge of this needs to come forth with a little more than they are giving us.\"\nHe spoke to what he thinks the voters are concerned about.\n\"Safety overall. We have lots of concerns about traffic,\" he said. \"There is an influx of people moving to Caroline County — a lot of people want to make it more, and a lot of people like how life is, or was.\"\n\"... A challenge is to figure out the right way to expand Ridgely. How to contain the influx of people coming over but still keeping the small-town values. Ridgely is a great town to live in. Being in the Lions Club and organizing the town flea market, I have met a lot of amazing people. I have put a lot of volunteer work into the town,\" Leister said.\nThe winner of Monday's election will serve a three-year term as the town's commissioner.\nThe polls will be open from 1 to 7 p.m. April 22 at 2 Central Avenue — the town hall. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is not enough votes to alter the outcomes of these amendments, but exact vote totals may change in the coming days.\nQUESTION AThe first question on the ballot for Dorchester County residents asked whether the county charter should be amended to say that the review of administrative structure be conducted within the first fiscal year of each Dorchester County Council term.\nCurrently, the charter says a review of administrative structure should take place at least every four years, but it does not state when in that four years it should take place.\nNearly 90% of Dorchester County voters chose to approve the amendment as of totals posted Friday.\nQUESTION BThe second question on the ballot asked whether budget-related due dates should be pushed back 15 days in the county charter.\nThe first due date is for when the county must prepare the budget by. The ballot question asked if that due date should be changed to May 15 from May 1. The question also asked if the county council's budget adoption due date should be changed to June 15 from May 31.\nAbout 76% of ballots counted by Friday voted to approve the change.\nQUESTION CThe third question asked whether the county charter should be amended to remove the residency requirement for the county manager position.\nCurrently, the charter states the county manager does not have to reside in the county at the time they are appointed but must become a resident within six months. It states that the county manager needs to retain residency in the county for the duration of their time in that position.\nAbout 61% of county voters chose to retain the requirements, according to totals posted Friday.\nQUESTION DThe fourth question on the ballot asked whether the charter should be amended to clarify certain responsibilities of the county manager, including day-to-day operations, and establish procedures for certain vacancies.\nCurrently, the charter has procedures in place for council member and treasurer vacancies, as well as certain board and commission vacancies.\nMore than 87% of Dorchester County voters had chosen to approve the amendment as of Friday.\nQUESTION EThe fifth question asked whether the county charter should be amended to remove the residency requirement for the finance director position.\nCurrently, the charter states the finance director must become a resident of the county within six months of appointment and stay a resident.\nJust under 60% of county voters had chosen not to approve the change as of Friday.\nQUESTION FThe final question on the ballot asked whether the charter should be amended to include language to ensure transparency of governmental functions as well as access to open meetings and public records.\nDorchester County voters overwhelmingly supported the amendment, which had received approval from almost 93% of the electorate as of Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The extensive revision includes housekeeping items and definition changes to make the documentation flow better.\nUpdates to the animal control ordinance include three full document reviews, hundreds of hours of work and strong collaboration from officials including Animal Control, emergency services and animal services, according to Nowak.\nA public hearing regarding the ordinance is expected at the commissioner's March 26 meeting.\nIn other business, Queen Anne's County Animal Services (QACAS) presented 2023 overviews and 2024 projections to the county commissioners.\nAnimal Services Chief of Services Kelly Hamilton presented a year in review and projections for the shelter moving forward.\nThe shelter continues to lead the way in providing care care for forlorn animals of the Eastern Shore with an impact stronger than ever, she said, it was a very successful year of diligent volunteers, engaging events, and successful community support and 2024 only looks to continue.\nThe organization considers itself a quintessential No-Kill Shelter of the state of Maryland and the Eastern Shore, Hamilton said, with the Live Release Rate determined by the number of animals leaving the shelter via adoption, returned to the owner or transferred to another shelter.\nThe national standard to be considered a No Kill Shelter is 90% and with a 94.6% rate, QACAS is proud to be one of 12 such shelters in Maryland, she said.\nA total of 1,324 animals entered the county's shelter in 2023, whether as strays, seized or transferred in, a 29% increase from 2022, according to Hamilton.\nThrough QACAS, 679 animals found their \"furr-ever\" families in 2023, she announced.\nNearly 900 surgeries were performed onsite ranging from routine neuters, to life saving procedures.\nThe shelter has ramped up its social media presence including facial recognition software to instrumentally connect owners and pets and help 166 animals find their way back home in 2023.\n\"It's amazing, the technology is there,\" Hamilton said.\nHamilton credited volunteers and foster families as the \"true heroes\" for their tireless dedication to the animals.\n\"It really takes our team to invest all this time and energy in these animals to get them ready for that adoption floor,\" she said.\nFoster families are imperative to provide valuable insight into an animal's behavior outside of the shelter to provide \"purr-fect\" placement for prospective adopters.\nPrograms include doggy day trips in hopes of enticing new foster families with a day of play away from the kennels, which can often snowball into full blown adoptions.\nIQACAS participated in a National Clear the Shelter Event to roaring success, seeing nearly 100 animals find homes in a very short amount of time, she said.\nOther community events include Puppy Yoga, donation drives, and partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department for the first annual \"Pawing in Love\" Fun Run.\nMoving forward, the shelter expects to see an increase in community involvement including school education programs and \"bigger and better\" fundraisers, Hamilton said.\nThe facility has undergone remodeling to include updated in house dental machines and a new lobby layout. The shelter is now home to new cat condos, improved yard spaces, and even surround sound speakers at the dog kennels to provide calming ambiance.\nWith its newly improved yard space, they plan to offer additional enrichment programs for dog training including daily doggie play groups.\nA complimentary behaviorist class is available for all newly adopted dogs. This program will serve residents who may be considering surrendering animals to the shelter for behavioral concerns or are in need of training tips, according to Hamilton.\nQACAS looks to continue leading the pack as a local No Kill Shelter with updated technology and infrastructure improvements to provide community critters the best care \"pawsible.\"\nMore information about the QACAS, including upcoming events can be found at www.qac.org/1425/Animal-Services. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This campaign unfairly targets our schools, students, and dedicated Talbot County Public Schools educators.\nOur team does face challenges like many school districts, and we face them directly and with transparency. While we do not want to give life to these messages you are receiving, we want to make sure our community knows the truth.\nWe are working to improve our performance on state assessments. With support from the Talbot County Council, we have made significant investments, including acquiring new rigorous standards-based curricula and hiring and retaining qualified teachers and administrators. Additionally, we have made math one of our priorities and are putting concentrated efforts into the teaching and learning of this curricular area. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\nWhile we know we have work to do, there is growth we can celebrate. The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all Maryland districts. In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress was slightly greater than what the state achieved. In English/Language Arts, out of the 24 school districts, Talbot County Public Schools had the greatest increase in students being proficient. These results inform our continued work on the initiatives put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success.\nWe adhere to the Health Education Standards set forth by the Maryland Department of Education. Maryland state law requires that parents/guardians be notified about topics covered in the Family Life unit. They have the option of having their student excused if they are uncomfortable with this content being taught to their students by TCPS educators.\nOur Talbot County students graduate from our high schools and continue to excel in college, career and life. This is a result of their hard work, the commitment of the TCPS team, the leadership of the Board of Education and the support of the County Council and our many community partners.\nOur support staff, teachers and administrators are dedicated professionals who deserve our trust and support. By collaborating openly and constructively, we can ensure that our school system remains a beacon of opportunity and excellence for every child, regardless of their background.\nWe invite the community to our established public forums scheduled each month through our regular Board of Education meetings. These meetings are open to all citizens, and we encourage everyone to attend and participate in these sessions. Only through collaboration and communication do we truly provide the best opportunities for our students.\nWe are honored to serve as Talbot County's superintendent of schools and president of the Board of Education, and we are very proud of our students and staff. We believe in and will continue to advocate for TCPS students, families and educators. We are TCPS, and we are committed to transforming and performing together.\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at info@talbotschools.org. We are here for you and all of the children of Talbot County. Thank you for your continued support.\nSharon Pepukayi is the superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools. Emily Jackson is president of the Talbot County Board of Education. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

However, it isn't immediately apparent how the declarer can thwart West's dastardly scheme.Also, even then an ice-cool West might thwart South's thwart!\nDefending against four spades, West leads the club ace: three, four, 10. He switches to the diamond nine, two, 10 How should South continue?\nGiven North's opening bid, West must have led a singleton club ace. South must win trick two, to stop the lethal club ruff. However, even with a singleton, West's lead is unattractive. So declarer can place king-third of spades with West: some measure of trump control.\nIf this is the position and he attacks trumps now, West is bound to score a club ruff, East having a diamond entry.\nHave you seen the key play?\nSouth must hope that West has the heart jack. At trick three, he leads the heart ace, squashing dummy's king.\nThen he cashes the heart queen, discarding one of dummy's diamonds, and continues with the heart 10.\nAssuming West covers with the jack, declarer discards dummy's last diamond.\nWhen South regains the lead, he plays the spade ace and another spade. East never wins a trick, so West never gets his ruff.\nHowever, if West has the courage to play low smoothly on the heart 10, he might deflect declarer to defeat.\nThinking East has the heart jack, South might decide his only chance is to ruff and play the spade ace and another spade, hoping the trumps are 2-2.\nIf an opponent wants you to play a particular card, don't. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Strand Beach Project To Be Completed By Summer\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; Mtrovato@Chespub.Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 839\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD - With the first phase of construction complete, Oxford's Shoreline Improvement project along the Strand is expected to be complete by summer.Oxford Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said the first part of the project, to build the shoreline infrastructure, \"touched on nearly all parts of the project.\"\nThis part, which was completed before Thanksgiving, included building a berm between the road and the water, placing hooks along the east and west areas of the Strand to help bring sand in and creating small islands in the water to reduce the waves that come onto the beach.\nLewis said these island structures were built using a combination of rock, wood chips and other components.\n\"(The structures) will sit over the winter months, which allows them to stabilize,\" Lewis said. \"It allows them to go through weather, high tides, we just had a fairly substantial storm, that sort of stuff.\"\nOxford Police Chief Eric Kellner said the construction brought in extra traffic, particularly with all of the materials that were brought in using larger vehicles like dump trucks.\nIn order to allow space for workers to do their job and to prevent damage to civilian vehicles, Kellner said that the police department, with the help of Public Works, closed the beach parking lot.\nThere were some concerns from residents about the large construction vehicles speeding in the area, Kellner said.\n\"In response to that, we did a few things,\" he said.\n\"One was, obviously, we ran radar to enforce the speed limits. And we also deployed our speed sign to remind the vehicles of their speed in hopes of calming any potential speed issues.\"\nKellner said that in running radar and collecting data from the speed sign, the police department really sees an issue with speeding.\nHe said that large and loud vehicles driving down a small, narrow street can sometimes give off the perception that the driver is speeding.\n\"Our findings were that most of those larger vehicles were following the rules of the road,\" he said.\nIn the spring, the second part of the project is set to begin.\n\"We're estimating April,\" Lewis said. \"I mean a lot of this is dependent on weather temperatures, asphalt, plants, a lot of factors.\"\nLewis said the second part will include adding plants to the new structures, adding signage, elevating land on the far east end and making improvements to the parking lot.\n\"The whole concept is to build a higher area all along the Strand to protect it from the stormwaters off the river,\" Lewis said.\nThe parking lot will be built with storm management areas underneath it so that storm water can enter it and be filtered before going back out. The parking lot will be paved with asphalt, with a cobble layer underneath it.\n\"There's a lot of - not just tidal water coming from the river - but also stormwater settling along that road in the parking lot,\" Lewis said.\n\"So bringing all of that elevation up to prevent that and allowing the water to go under the road and then back out into the creek will basically build resilience for that whole area.\"\nLewis said that as the sea level rises and the intensity of storms increase, infrastructure along the Strand becomes more vulnerable.\n\"Keep in mind, this is the only road we really have that runs along the water,\" she said. \"This area here, it's worthy of this type of resilience protection because a breach in any place, especially up near the parking lot, would be so difficult to repair.\"\nLewis called it a project for the future.\n\"With the impacts of sea level rise and stormwater and tidal water management that we're seeing currently,\" she said, \"it's necessary to look at how to build in these areas with natural infrastructure that will help to protect it in the future.\"\nDavid Ghysels, who walks along the Strand every day, said he thinks the project will be nice when it is complete, particularly if it helps with flooding.\nLewis said she has received positive and negative comments from residents on the project.\n\"I think the closer you are to the project physically, the more involved you may have been over the last five years,\" she said. \"So I think that one of the impacts will be people who don't go there regularly or aren't involved in the government regularly all of a sudden want to know what happened. So it's really just a continued educational process.\"\nMac Sommerlatte, who lives next to the beach, said he thinks the project should, when finished, positively impact the town by minimizing shoreline erosion and mitigating the impact of sea level rise. He said the project is a complicated one.\n\"I think one of the problems is that there are several projects here,\" he said.\n\"It's not just one. And people don't seem to have the complete information on all of them. And they may disagree with parts of it.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n A sign at the Strand Beach in Oxford on Dec. 12 saying that the Shoreline Improvement project will be completed after a few months of an adjustment period, which will allow the new infrastructure to settle. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton council rejects Gunsallus' proposal to delay introduction of campaign finance law\n\n April 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 784\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Town Council members held a heated discussion Monday on a proposed ordinance mandating campaign finance reporting in town elections.Before the opening Pledge of Allegiance and prayer, council President Frank Gunsallus moved to remove the campaign finance law's introduction from Monday's meeting agenda.\nGunsallus said the law shouldn't be introduced due to current conflicts of interest existing with the town's upcoming election.\nMayor Megan Cook and Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery announced their sponsorship of the ordinance last week. It comes as the town's May 6 election nears, with Gunsallus facing off against current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello in an increasingly heated race. Montgomery, along with Ward 1's Maureen Curry, have publicly endorsed Abbatiello.\nOn Monday, Gunsallus read a letter he sent to the Attorney General's Office, requesting guidance for how to proceed with the ordinance that he called \"retroactive.\"\nMontgomery and town attorney Sharon VanEmburgh, who drafted the ordinance, said the ordinance would not retroactively apply to the May 6 election.\n\"This won't apply to this election,\" VanEmburgh said. \"If you're thinking about a conflict, there will always be a conflict for all five of you because you will all at some point potentially be running for reelection. This is for a future election.\"\nGunsallus said he didn't feel comfortable discussing the ordinance without clarification from the attorney general. VanEmburgh said the attorney general has no authority over the town election, later adding it's unlikely the attorney general will offer an official opinion to Gunsallus' request.\nWhen Gunsallus said he would not entertain the ordinance as an agenda item, Montgomery moved to overrule him and was joined by the remaining three council members.\n\"All we're saying is that we want to move forward with (the ordinance) at a first reading,\" Curry said.\nTHE ORDINANCE\nAs drafted, the ordinance would require candidates to have a treasurer file campaign contribution reports to the town before and after the election. It would also set a maximum $250 contribution limit for all individuals, businesses and organizations, excluding the candidate and their spouse or partner.\nCouncilmembers shared mixed thoughts.\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said it's a \"good starting point\" but emphasized it needs to use \"inclusive language.\"\nCurry said, \"not everyone has a spouse\" and asked if the limits would apply to other family members. VanEmburgh said as written, other family members would need to adhere to the $250 cap.\nCouncil members agreed to further discuss the ordinance at a workshop May 19. Residents, though, were more steadfast in their concerns during a heated public comment session.\nResident Daniel McBride said the $250 limit \"seems a bit arbitrary\" and \"serves as a barrier to free expression of town voters.\" McBride and other residents said it would put grassroots or less wealthy candidates at a disadvantage.\nResidents also questioned Montgomery and Cook for introducing the ordinance so soon before next month's election, with some labeling it election interference and an attack on Gunsallus' campaign.\n\"I believe it was done to try to destroy one of the members of the council,\" Catherine Nobles said.\nCAMPAIGN DONATIONS\nAt the onset of Monday's meeting, Gunsallus asked the council to \"follow my lead by disclosing your campaign finances ... with the state.\" He has been reporting online through the Maryland Campaign Reporting Information System each January since he was elected.\nIn the system, the most recent filing from the Friends of Frank Gunsallus shows campaign finances from Jan. 11, 2024 through Jan. 8, 2025.\nMontgomery encouraged Gunsallus to report finances from his ongoing campaign.\n\"I do not understand how you can claim that you have revealed your campaign expenditures in the state when there's nothing there,\" Montgomery said.\nGunsallus said Monday that transparency is \"paramount\" and he will continue reporting through the state next January. Tuesday, Gunsallus told The Star Democrat that he's received approximately $16,000 in campaign contributions from 34 donors.\nAbbatiello sent a log of campaign donations to the town office Monday.\nFrom Dec. 29, 2024, through Monday, Abbatiello has brought in just over $13,000. More than 70 individual donors are listed, though Abbatiello said he's not releasing their specific donation amounts since \"many people donated believing their names and donations would not end up on a list or scrutinized by the public.\"\n\"I also think that what's more important than the dollar amount, is that with only a few exceptions, the donors live in Easton,\" Abbatiello wrote in an email to The Star Democrat. \"I'm also not taking any money from a political party or any group with a special interest in town.\"\nIn an interview with The Star Democrat's editorial board Tuesday, Gunsallus said the proposed campaign finance ordinance is \"nonsensical\" and that the town could instead fall in line with state law regarding campaign finance disclosures.\n\"We don't have to have political theater as we witnessed last night,\" Gunsallus said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Thirty-six foursomes (144 golfers) trekked out to do their best in the competition.Jacob Sloan tragically died in a car accident when he was only 12. A very unique child, attending Matapeake Middle School as a seventh grader, he was very active, being part of the school's band and choir. Jake also loved baseball, football, golf, swimming, and looking forward to winning the family's championship wrestling belt each year!But he also learned to care for those who appeared to be alone, each day leaving to go to school with a challenge from his parents to \"Make a difference today!\" If someone was sitting alone on the school bus or at a cafeteria lunch table, Jake would sit with them to make sure they weren't alone or needed a friend. He had a love and compassion for others at a early age.Upon his passing, his family created a foundation in his name, supported and funded by the annual golf tournament. The tournament has been so successful over the years, it has raised thousands of dollars which have been gifted to local charities, and people with children in need. Pete Sloan, Jake's father, reported at this year's golf tournament, \"We've been able to award just over 100 grants in Jake's name.\" \"Thank you all so much for making this a great day,\" Mary Sloan, Jake's mother said, \"Thank you to our growing number of sponsors, the largest number we've ever had. It's the best tournament we've had thus far!\" Participants from 13 different states joined this year's cause on the course.Added Pete, \"The people who support Jake's tournament are great people!\". \n \n Caption: DOUG BISHOP\n \nRiverside 18-hole golf course winners at the annual Jacob Sloan Memorial Golf Tournament, held Friday, Sept. 8, at the Queenstown Harbour Golf, from left: Pete Sloan, father of Jacob Sloan; golfer Steve Norcio of Olney; Mary Sloan, Jacob's mother; golfers John Seguin of Sandy Spring; Jim Smith of Centreville and Sean Hendrie of Chester.

What can I say about a person that has spent his entire life in a town and cares enough to spend over 30 years in its political system?Dedication and love for his community are words that come to mind. With so many towns struggling across the country, look at Easton.Bob has worked diligently with his peers to help build Easton into the must live-in town that it now is.His efforts and results are too countless to mention.

    "content": "CASA is grateful for its volunteers this holiday season\n\n November 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CASA OF THE MID-SHORE | Section: News \n \n 313\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n At CASA of the Mid-Shore, we are committed to advocating for children under the protection of the Talbot, Dorchester, Queen Anne's and Kent circuit courts due to abuse, neglect or abandonment. Our nonprofit organization's mission is to ensure that every child has the right to thrive in a safe and permanent home.CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) volunteers play a vital role in this mission. As caring and involved adults, they work to identify the unique needs of each child, advocate in court for essential services, and collaborate with agency partners to facilitate timely and safe resolutions.\nMost importantly, CASA volunteers become trusted figures in the lives of the children they serve, often providing stability, support and consistency.\nThis commitment is especially significant during the holiday season. For many children, this time of year is about creating joyful memories with family. However, for those placed in foster care, the holidays can be a stark reminder of their circumstances and what they are missing. CASA volunteers offer vital support, helping these children find hope amidst the challenges.\n\"Speaking up for children is our guiding principle,\" said Robin Davenport, CASA's executive director. \"It reinforces our belief that a brighter future is possible for every child we serve... As we approach the holiday season, we are profoundly grateful for our extraordinary CASA volunteers. Their unwavering dedication to vulnerable children is a true treasure in our community.\"\nNational studies confirm the value of CASA — findings show that children are more hopeful when a CASA is in their lives.\nCASA volunteers come from all walks of life, have varied experiences and professions, and are at least 21 years of age. After completing the application and screening process, individuals participate in pre-service training before being sworn in as officers of the court. CASA welcomes volunteers from all cultures, races, ethnicities and backgrounds.\nTo learn more about becoming a volunteer, visit casamidshore.org or email jc@casamidshore.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trial begins for Cambridge man charged in 2022 shooting\n\n October 25, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 493\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - The sunny, warm afternoon of Sept. 20, 2022, was a perfect day for a family birthday barbecue in Cambridge. Around 3 p.m., everything changed.Numerous officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to the area of Rigby Avenue and Fairmount Avenue for a report of shots fired around 3:05 p.m. Police spread out, canvassing the area nearby for any witnesses.Minutes later, officers found the body of20 year-old Kevin Raeford laying in a wooded area near the 600 block of Edgewood Avenue. Police officers would later testify that Raeford's body was covered by a blanket.About 20 minutes after police were dispatched, Raeford was pronounced dead by medics. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by gunshot wound.Only one person is responsible for Raeford's death, and it wasn't a random shooter - it was Raeford's cousin, Geett Cornish, said Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, pointing toward Cornish across the courtroom at the outset of his trial Tuesday.Cornish, 31, of Cambridge, faces first-and second-degree murder, assault, reckless endangerment and handgun charges in connection to the shooting that left Raeford dead.Family members who were present that day would be called to testify against Cornish, sharing emotions they'd struggled with for the past year, Leonard said. The family would provide the 'who' of the case, while others, including law enforcement, would fill in the 'what' and the 'where' of the shooting.But to Baltimore-based defense attorney Brad MacFee, testimony from three other civilian witnesses, along with Raeford's affiliation with a local gang, would be key for the jurors deciding the case.In his opening statement, MacFee asserted that Cambridge has a gang problem - a \"significant, substantial\" one. Raeford was a member of a more prominent local gang, and gangs and violence go together like peanut butter and jelly, he said.Two of MacFee's three three highlighted witnesses were possibly affiliated with gangs, and all three had varying motives to lie about what happened that day, including concerns about gang reprisal and fear of going back to jail, he said.\"My client's fate relies on whether or not you believe these three guys. That's it,\" he said.By lunchtime Tuesday, five witnesses had testified, including Raeford's mother, his girlfriend and three Cambridge Police officers.Testimony from police established the discovery of two separate crime scenes. The first, located at Fairmount Avenue and Rigby Avenue, was where officers found spent casings and blood spatter.The second scene, the wooded area near Edgewood Avenue, was where Raeford's body was found.MacFee asked three of the five witnesses about gang violence in the city, echoing his assertions from the opening statements.Testimony from a Maryland State Police crime scene technician, a ballistics expert and a medical examiner were expected Tuesday afternoon.Additional witnesses are expected to testify Wednesday and Thursday. A verdict is anticipated Friday. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER Crime scene tape blocked off the portion of Edgewood Avenue in Cambridge where a shooting victim was found by police responding to reports of gunshots on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022.\n \nGEETT CORNISH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Frank Gunsallus is the only person on the Easton Town Council who has been self reporting all of his campaign finances.\nAnyone who desires to look further only has to refer to the link provided in Ms. Trovato's article that was published on April 15.\nIt seems as if the mayor and Mr. Montgomery are creating fear, division and conspiracy. Especially right before an election.\nYes, there are billboards and signs around. This is politics and getting your name out is one of the foremost goals of any political race.\nThis action shows the voters exactly who the mayor and David Montgomery really are. So the question is truly now to the voters: Do you want this kind of mayor? And this kind of ward representative who wouldn't choose to wait until after the election? No, my bet is on the voters of Easton who are able to see right through this political sham.\nPlease attend Monday night's council meeting and get your voice heard.

Last week, Talbot County Council members introduced the same resolution to appear on the 2024 general election ballot.During a May 28 meeting, the council unanimously introduced a resolution to place a question on the ballot at the 2024 general election to amend section 614 of the charter of Talbot County to allow the council to add up to one cent per $100 of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years beginning July 1, 2026.\nAccording to the resolution document, the original resolution was adopted by a 5-0 vote of the Talbot County Council on July 21, 2020. The resolution was approved by the majority of Talbot County voters at the 2020 general election.\nThis resolution would \"allow but not require\" the Talbot County Council to add up to one cent per one hundred dollars of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years.\nTalbot County Attorney Patrick Thomas said that as of July 1, 2021, revenues derived from property taxes included in the constant yield tax rate certification shall not increase more than 2% from the previous year.\nThis increase has helped offset the county's costs of maintaining public safety, officials said.\nClay Stamp, the county manager of Talbot County, said he was a public supporter of the resolution when it was initially introduced because it would assist in providing quicker services for the residents of Talbot County.\nOver the last fiscal year, the one-cent initiative has provided about $200,000 for the county to offset the public safety budget, which includes law enforcement, fire departments and other emergency services.\nWhen reintroduced in May, Council Member Dave Stepp said over half of Talbot County voters supported this resolution in 2020. The funds generated from this resolution have solved many problems Stepp has seen in neighboring counties, he said.\n\"It would benefit our public services here in Talbot County,\" Stepp said. \"The names of the departments that would make it to the ballot question would be the Sheriff's department, Department of Emergency Services as well as the Department of Corrections. We've seen a lot of positive things that have happened in those departments over the years.\"\nStepp asked his fellow council members to support the resolution and allow residents to decide whether or not they would like to see it implemented for the following five years.\nThe council unanimously voted to introduce the resolution. A public hearing will be on Tuesday, June 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'It's iconic': Tunis Mills residents push back against county design for bridge replacement\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 692\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — More than 50 people gathered at St Stephens AME Church Wednesday evening to engage with county leaders regarding proposed construction to replace the Leeds Creek Bridge in Tunis Mills.County employees and project engineers presented plans to replace the 345-foot wooden bridge. Designs propose a structure with a \"laminated timber deck\" and \"asphalt wearing surface.\"\nResidents living in and around Tunis Mills expressed a bevy of concerns about county designs Wednesday evening. Many testified to the bridge's uniqueness and fit in the community, while others are worried an asphalt surface would jeopardize the safety for residents, particularly children and teenagers.\n\"People love this bridge, it's iconic,\" Doug Marvin, who lives near the bridge, said. \"I didn't grow up here, and I heard about it years before I bought the house where I did. It's like tradition for every kid that goes to school in this county to jump off the bridge … It's used in photographs, for tourism, to get people to come to this county.\"\nPrompted by a question from the audience, nearly every single attendee raised a hand when posed with the choice of a timber surface versus an asphalt one.\nAt the end of the meeting, County Manager Clay Stamp said that the county and its public works department \"will go back to the drawing board to a degree\" to explore the wooden surface option.\n\"At this point I think it's fair to assure you that moving in the direction of a wooden deck bridge is the direction we are seeking,\" Stamp said.\nPROJECT DESIGNSThe meeting began with a presentation of the proposed designs, which the county has said is around 90 to 95% complete.\nProposed changes to the bridge include adding an additional two feet of clearance, replacing timber piles with steel piles, adding a wooden laminated deck that can be paved over, widening the bridge slightly for walkers and improving a ramp and unloading platform. Several other bridges in the county have undergone similar laminated deck replacements.\nThe Talbot County Council first discussed replacing the bridge in 2007, allocating $1.8 million to the replacement project. Now, the project's estimated cost is around $6 million, with around $4.5 million federally funded.\nMark Ledebur, an engineering consultant, noted drawbacks to a full timber structure at Wednesday's meeting.\nHe said county experiences show an asphalt surface is less labor-intensive, easier to plow, smoother and easier to replace. Ledebur also presented quotes obtained by the county for timber boards in the case of replacement.\nOne resident asked if the county could compare costs for timber boards and asphalt, along with how often each material may have to be replaced. County Engineer Ray Clarke said his department could work on those comparisons.\nA project schedule shown to attendees on Wednesday projected a final decision for the bridge replacement this September, though Clarke emphasized the county is not ready to submit and is keeping the option of a wooden surface open.\nRESIDENT INPUTSusan McDermott leads a citizen group vowing for the bridge on Tunis Mills Road to remain as a full wooden structure.\nThe group, which has met with the county in the past, asserts that a timber structure is more durable than other materials and has environmental benefits. During the meeting, McDermott emphasized that the Leeds Creek Bridge is unique compared to busier bridges in Talbot County.\n\"Don't put an asphalt smear in the middle of our community,\" McDermott said. \"We don't want it, and we don't need it.\"\nMany residents that spoke Wednesday said an asphalt surface would only encourage speeding across the bridge. Both the current posted speed limit and the proposed one are 15 mph.\nSome were worried for the safety of children and teenagers who jump off the bridge into the creek as an unofficial tradition in the area. Resident Claudia Donegan said kids \"interact with this bridge intimately.\"\nPeter Stifel lives right across from the bridge and has driven over it for almost 60 years. On Wednesday, Stifel said his support for a wooden replacement is a \"vote for tradition.\"\n\"It is the heart and soul of a village,\" Stifel said of the bridge. \"And I'd hate to see it succumb to the plastic, push-button world that we are all being forced into.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Enjoying the fall vegetables\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's that time of the year when summer is slowly slipping away and fall is approaching. All the signs are appearing — from the school bus to the pumpkins at the roadside stands.Growing up in the country, this time of year was usually when the potato baskets came out of storage. This meant that \"digging day\" was coming up. Mom would remind my sister and I that it would soon be storing food time. We had to scrub down the kitchen and the canning equipment after the summer harvest was processed and stored in the canning closet or the freezer.\nIt had been a long and busy summer both on the farm, in town, just about everywhere there is a kitchen and a family to feed. Even farmers, who made money selling crops, had to keep enough on hand to feed their families.\nNowadays, with the economy struggling, prices are going up on everything related to feeding the family. Families from all walks of life are preparing the food supply for winter months ahead. Makes you think of those families that survived times like the Great Depression.\nThis time of year in my family, most money went to school clothes or yards of fabric for clothes to be made at home. As always, we found joy in cooking or at mealtime. We never knew we were poor because so much thought and love was put into every piece of hand-stitched clothing or every plate of food on the table.\nLet's clean out those freezers and make room for the fall veggies. Besides stocking up on, and maybe freezing, the last of your summer produce, get ready for fall by picking up some fresh apples, basil, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, grapes, kale and potatoes.\nFall has always been my favorite season.\nBROCCOLI CHEDDAR CASSEROLE\n2 pounds broccoli (stems removed and crowns cut into florets), 2 strips thick-cut bacon cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips, 5 large eggs (beaten), 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 2 to 3 tsps freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tsps Dijon mustard, 8 oz cheddar cheese (grated).\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water). Add the broccoli florets and boil for 3 to 5 minutes or until just tender enough so that a fork can easily pierce the floret. Strain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. While the water in step one is coming to a boil, cook the bacon pieces on medium heat in a frying pan until lightly browned, but not crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat. Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 2.5-quart casserole dish or a foil pan. In a bowl, whisk the eggs into the flour, then whisk in the cream and milk. Add the black pepper (more or less to taste), salt, and mustard. Mix in about a third of the cheese. Place the blanched broccoli florets in the casserole dish, sprinkling about a third of the cheese over the broccoli florets as you lay them down. Sprinkle the bacon pieces over the broccoli. Pour the egg, cream, milk, cheese mixture over the broccoli, moving the broccoli pieces a bit so that the mixture gets into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese. Bake until the casserole is set, 25 to 40 minutes depending on the depth of the casserole dish. Once the top has browned, you may want to tent with aluminum foil to keep from burning.\nSHREDDED BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND KALE SALAD WITH APPLE, GORGONZOLA AND CANDIED PECANS\nFor the dressing: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, fresh ground pepper to taste. For the salad: 1 pound Brussels sprouts (thinly shredded),1 bunch of kale (stems removed, and leaves finely chopped), 2 medium apples (cored and thinly sliced), 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup candied pecans (chopped), 1/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese, 4 slices cooked chopped turkey bacon (optional).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, sugar and salt. In a separate large bowl, toss together shredded brussels sprouts and kale mixture with your hands. Slowly pour in dressing and use your hands to massage the kale and brussels sprouts for about 5 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to overnight to allow for dressing to soak into the kale and Brussels. Once ready to serve, toss in apple slices, dried cranberries and chopped candied pecans. If you'd like you can add in chopped bacon at this point and toss salad again. Finally, garnish with crumbled gorgonzola. Serve immediately. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\nEND OF SUMMER GRILLED VEGETABLES\n1 bell pepper cut into half-inch thick strips, 1 red onion cut into half-inch rounds or quarters, 1 zucchini cut into half-inch rounds, 1 yellow squash cut into half-inch rounds, 1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, 1/2 pound Brussels sprouts cut in half, 1/2 pound baby bella mushrooms, 2 ears corn (shucked and cleaned), 2 tbsps olive oil, freshly ground salt and pepper, 2 tsps garlic powder.\nPreheat your grill to medium or medium-high heat, which is about 375 to 400 degrees on a gas grill. Scrape off any leftover bits from the last time you grilled. Marinate your veggies or season them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. For large veggies like corn, bell pepper, thicker sliced zucchini, eggplant and onion, and portobello mushrooms, I recommend slicing, seasoning and putting them directly on the grill so that they get those lovely grill marks. Place your oiled and seasoned vegetables on the grill in a single layer, starting with the ones that take the longest to cook in the back where your grill is likely the hottest and finishing with the quick cooking vegetables in the front. Close the lid and let the veggies cook for about 5 minutes. Flip your veggies, starting with the closer ones. Then replace the lid and let them cook a few minutes more or until done to your liking. This goes great with any main dish.\nROASTED VEGGIES WITH PARMESAN AND OLIVE OIL\n1 large butternut squash (seeded and cut into cubes), 1 pound Brussels sprouts (halved), 3 large carrots (peeled and sliced), 2 large parsnips (peeled sliced), 1 large red onion (coarsely chopped), 12 garlic cloves (peeled), 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 1/2 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Add veggies to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, oregano, rosemary and garlic. Pour over veggies and toss to evenly distribute. Add in parmesan topping, salt and pepper and toss again until well coated. Pour on a baking sheet and spread out evenly. Roast in the oven for 35-45 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes, until squash is fork tender and sprouts are slightly crispy and caramelized.\nCOUNTRY STYLE BAKED SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE\n4 pounds baked sweet potatoes, ½ cup butter, ¼ cup light brown sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, ¾ cup chopped pecans, 3 cups mini marshmallows.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until very fork tender. This can be done up to 3 days ahead. Refrigerate the baked sweet potatoes if making ahead. Change the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Set out a large mixing bowl. Peel the loose skins off the hot baked sweet potatoes. Place them in the bowl. Add the butter, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Use an electric mixer to beat the sweet potatoes into a smooth mash. Set out a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Scoop the sweet potato mash into the dish and spread it out in an even layer. Sprinkle the chopped pecans on top. Then sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the pecans in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the marshmallows are golden and puffy. Serve warm.\nCABBAGE ROLLS\n1 head green cabbage, 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 pound ground pork, ½ pound ground beef, 2 small onions (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced), ½ tsp dill, 3 tbsps fresh parsley (chopped), salt and pepper to taste, 1 can diced tomatoes (14 oz), 1 egg, 1 ½ cups plus ⅓ cup tomato sauce (divided), 1 can tomato soup (10.5 oz).\nBoil cabbage leaves for about 2 minutes or until soft. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook rice according to package directions but reduce cooking time by 5 minutes. Set aside. Cook pork, beef, onions, garlic and seasonings in a pan until no pink remains. Drain any fat. Add in rice, diced tomatoes and ⅓ cup of tomato sauce. Stir in egg. Mix remaining tomato sauce and tomato soup in a bowl. Spread a very thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Remove thick stem on cabbage leaves. Lay the cabbage leaf flat and add ¼ to 1/3 cup filling to the center of the leaf. Fold in the sides and roll the cabbage up. Place seam side down in the pan. Repeat with remaining cabbage. Pour sauce over the cabbage and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 75-90 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.\nSUMMER VEGETABLE SOUP\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium yellow onion (finely diced), 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, 3-4 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 pound zucchini (sliced into half-moons), 1/2 pound summer squash (sliced into half-moons), 2 ears sweet corn (kernels removed), 1/2 pound green beans, 1/2 pound fresh tomatoes (diced), 1 pound red potatoes (cut into 1-inch cubes), 12 oz frozen lima beans, 15-oz can white beans (drained and rinsed), 7 cups vegetable broth, ¼ cup fresh chopped parsley plus more for topping, 1/2 tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper, 2 tbsps lemon juice.\nIn a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and fresh rosemary sprigs. Sauté for 6-8 minutes, or until onion is translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and sauté a minute more. Carefully remove rosemary sprigs. Add all vegetables: zucchini, squash, sweet corn kernels, green beans, tomatoes, frozen lima beans, red potatoes and white beans. Cover in vegetable broth. Stir in salt, pepper and fresh parsley. If extra liquid is needed to fully cover the vegetables, add ½ cup water at a time until vegetables are fully submerged. Cover with a lid. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, uncover and reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered until potato is softened, about 12-15 minutes. When the potatoes and vegetables are tender, stir in fresh lemon juice. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve topped with fresh parmesan and additional fresh chopped parsley. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "DELAY OF GAME\n\n February 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Domonique Foxworth played his first organized tackle football game at 10 years old.Now Foxworth has a son who turns 11 on Super Bowl Sunday who wants to play tackle. Foxworth won't allow it. His son is playing flag football instead.\nWhen might he allow his son to play tackle? Foxworth said, \"We'll see.\"\n\"It's definitely not going to be before high school,\" said Foxworth, a former NFL cornerback and former president of the NFL Players Association. \"I guess that would be the first time that we even consider the conversation. Right now he's in the fifth grade, so we've got some time for him to fall in love with something else.\"\nInterviews with several former NFL players, some of whom played tackle football before high school, revealed a range of opinions about whether children should participate in tackle leagues.\nSome are categorically opposed to youth playing tackle before age 12 or 14. Others said they would consider what a child wanted. All interviewed for this article said their thoughts about the sport had evolved since their days as youth players.\n\"I honestly don't see the benefit of playing tackle football at a young age because flag football now is so available,\" said Muhammad Oliver, a former defensive back who played four years in the NFL.\nOliver said if taught correctly the skills learned in flag football can translate to tackle football. He said flag football allows kids to pick up the fundamentals of the sport and understand how it's played.\nOliver has seven children, four of whom are boys ages 27, 23, 12 and 9. His oldest son, Isaiah, plays for the San Francisco 49ers. Oliver allowed Isaiah to begin playing in a tackle league at age 8. If he had it to do over again, he said, Isaiah wouldn't have played tackle football until he was 12.\nOliver said his experience as a youth tackle football coach and as president of NX Level AthletX, a youth multisport development program in Goodyear, Arizona, has influenced his thinking. So has recent medical research linking youth tackle football to later-life challenges, such as impulse control and cognitive decline.\n\"With all the information now about concussions and how often concussions are happening and the number of concussions that players have had over their lifetime, I just don't feel like the contact is necessary young,\" Oliver said.\nFormer Super Bowl champion and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson has been outspoken in warning of the risks of brain injury from the sport.\nIn 2018, Carson was one of the ex-players to appear at a news conference sponsored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation announcing a campaign to discourage tackle football before the age of 14. Carson has repeatedly said in interviews that if he had it to do again, he would not have played football.\nNeither of Carson's two sons played football at a competitive level, he said. Carson, who played 13 seasons for the New York Giants, has discouraged his grandson from playing.\nCarson advocates for transparency and education. \"I would like for the surgeon general to issue a warning to parents,\" he said, adding that adults should understand the risks of the sport.\n\"Every parent should sign a waiver to fully understand what they are signing their kids up for when they play football or a contact sport,\" Carson said.\n\"Most parents of little boys of color will continue to allow their kids to play,\" Carson said, \"because, you know, they don't want to deny their kids the opportunity to play because he has talent … not fully understanding that their kids may suffer the consequences down the road.\"\nThat differs somewhat from the view of Bruce Harper, a former New York Jets running back and kick returner whose NFL career lasted from 1977 to 1984. Harper never had to face a parental decision about youth football. He has two daughters, neither of whom played the sport.\nHowever, Harper said the decision should be left to the child.\n\"It's a decision each kid individually has to make. I don't think the parents should decide for the kid if they can play or not,\" he said.\nThe NFLPA has no formal policy regarding tackle football for kids. However, the players union has backed several youth initiatives including both tackle and flag football. The players union also supports members serving on the boards of USA Football and other youth leagues. Additionally, the union provides financial and community support to players running football camps for kids, but these camps primarily stay away from tackle.\n\"We encourage every level of football … to implement the health and safety protocols we have at the NFL level,\" said George Atallah, the NFLPA's assistant executive director of external affairs. \"We don't have a specific position on when we think young people should play it. That's for the medical experts to determine.\"\nFoxworth, who played for three teams from 2005-2011, sustained many injuries throughout his career. He's been able to deal with injuries to his body, but brain injury will always be something he's mindful of.\n\"I still wouldn't trade it for the life that I've had access to,\" Foxworth said of his football career. \"But it's all a different conversation when you start talking about your brain.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore legislators discuss education funding and county burdens\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Speaking to Eastern Shore legislators Friday, the Department of Legislative Services outlined how local governments may assume costs passed down from the state as Gov. Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might think that experts never fall from grace in this respect, but you would be wrong.Today's deal comes from a match between two different countries. How should South play in six hearts after West leads the diamond five?At the other table, North-South stopped in four hearts, making five. This pair was more adventurous. Three diamonds was a transfer bid, East doubling to show good diamonds. Throwing caution to the winds, North rebid a quantitative four notrump.(If he had wanted to ask for aces or key cards immediately, he would have used a Texas transfer at the four-level.) South, despite having minimum count and two diamond losers, took a shot at the slam.The declarer won the first trick with his diamond ace and drew trumps in three rounds. Then he paused to assess the situation - too late.He should have noted that he had only 11 winners: three spades, five hearts, one diamond and two clubs. It was necessary to capture a third club winner.The right line is to draw only two rounds of trumps, keeping an honor in the South hand. Then declarer plays off his three top spades, discarding one of dummy's clubs. A club to the ace, a club to the king and a club ruff follow. South, thankful to see the 3-3 split, plays a trump to his jack (or king) and cashes the club nine, discarding one of dummy's diamond losers. He concedes just one diamond trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland session concludes with balanced budget\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marissa Yelenik and Sofia Appolonio Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1120\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers passed a budget on Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with a tough fiscal reality and new federal policies.The end-of-session agreement hikes taxes and cuts programs to balance the spending plan for the 2026 fiscal year, assuming the federal funding picture does not change radically in the months to come.\nLawmakers made the budget work partly by trimming back the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the ambitious 2021 education reform plan meant to improve public schools. Architects of the deal said the changes will preserve the Blueprint's priorities.\n\"We present a budget that puts Maryland in a strong fiscal position and faces the challenges ahead while protecting our shared values and priorities,\" said Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone. (D-Howard).\nBut House Minority Whip Del. Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick, Carroll) argued that the plan unnecessarily burdens taxpayers.\n\"A majority of my colleagues feel very strongly that we could have balanced the budget without raising taxes,\" Pippy said. \"I don't think the direction of the state is the direction that most Marylanders want to go in.\"\nRepublicans made their mark on legislative work in the opening months of the new presidential administration, which helped give rise to the newly formed Maryland Freedom Caucus.\nStill, the Democrat-controlled legislature generally opposed President Donald Trump's policies.\nThe state — home to the most federal workers in the country outside of Washington, D.C. — likely faces continuing challenges with the Trump administration's mass government layoffs. At present, one Democratic leader said, the number of fired workers in Maryland stands at about 11,000.\n\"We expect that number to climb to 30,000, and there are many more contractors, probably at least double that amount,\" said Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard, Montgomery).\nThe legislature might have to reconvene at some point this year to cope with unemployment and changes in federal policy affecting Maryland. For now, though, the General Assembly has settled a range of issues.\nBUDGET\nThe $67 billion spending plan addresses a significant deficit through approximately $2 billion in spending cuts and $1.6 billion in tax changes.\nThe budget raises income taxes on the state's higher earners, extends the sales tax to certain technology services and introduces a $5 tire fee. It includes two new tax brackets, increases the standard deduction, phases out itemized deductions for those in higher tax brackets and includes tax hikes on individual goods and services.\nMany lawmakers celebrated its passage, but some said increasing the standard deduction would lead to service cuts in lower-income counties that rely on the income tax of low- and middle-income residents. The finalized plan will now go to Moore for consideration.\nENERGY\nEnergy was a hot topic this session as lawmakers worked to address high energy prices. They passed a three-bill package on Monday.\nThe package focuses on new in-state energy generation, ratepayer protections and reforms, solar siting and permitting and the creation of a state energy planning office. It outlines procurement processes for nuclear, battery storage and dispatchable energy, and removes trash incineration from the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard.\n\"I think, on balance, it's a good package,\" said Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), chair of the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment committee.\nThe package initially drew criticism from environmental advocates, who were concerned one of the bills would lead to new natural gas development in the state. But the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund praised the bill as passed, saying in a statement that it \"will likely reduce the chance of new gas plant construction in the state and … will advance a host of clean energy priorities,\" including battery storage.\nRepublican critics worry that the package doesn't do enough to help ratepayers.\nEDUCATION\nBlueprint funding was the subject of debate during the legislative session. In January, Moore proposed short-term cuts to mitigate the cost of the massive education plan, pushing back and pausing funding for different programs.\nThe education budget came under even more scrutiny late in the session when an expected $418 million in federal funds was suddenly in jeopardy. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced the end of a pandemic-era fund for state educational spending.\nAs it stands, state lawmakers agreed to postpone the Blueprint requirement that teachers receive a set amount of planning every school week, delaying it for three years. Additional Blueprint funding was decreased through freezes and cuts.\nJUSTICE SYSTEM\nLawmakers passed a bill to let prisoners access medical or geriatric parole more easily by allowing them to prove they are no longer a threat to others. It would not apply to those serving life sentences without parole or those on the sex offender registry. Geriatric parole would only be available to those over 65 who have served at least 20 years of their sentence.\nLawmakers also approved the Maryland Second Look Act, which aimed to reduce the sentences of some inmates with good behavior credits.\nA proposal to scale back the state's practice of automatically sentencing teen offenders as adults in violent crimes stalled in committee. The bill faced pushback from law enforcement over concerns that the Department of Juvenile Services couldn't accommodate juveniles with \"complex problems.\"\nPRIVACY\nConcerns over the Trump administration's immigration policy encouraged some lawmakers to propose the Maryland Data Privacy Act to prevent law enforcement and other local officials from sharing sensitive data with immigration officers. The bill failed to receive enough support.\nDespite concerns about unregulated police drones, lawmakers decided not to advance a proposal to set guidelines for law enforcement uses of aerial surveillance.\nDISABILITIES\nLawmakers passed Eric's ID Law — a measure allowing individuals with invisible disabilities to include a sticker on the bottom of their license, identification or moped operator's permit. The notation is meant to improve interactions and communication with law enforcement.\nREPARATIONS\nMaryland lawmakers approved the creation of a commission to study the impact of slavery after years of debate and consideration. The Maryland Reparations Commission would make recommendations to the state legislature, providing guidance on what, if any, benefits should be given to those impacted by historical inequality by November 2027.\nSEX ABUSE\nAfter emotional deliberation, lawmakers voted to downsize the monetary compensation the state can provide for sexual abuse lawsuits, amending the amount survivors can file for under the 2023 Child Victims Act.\nGENDER-AFFIRMING CARE\nRepublicans introduced a bill that would have made it a felony for a healthcare provider to give hormone replacement therapy to any minor, but the measure did not pass.\nIf passed, the Fairness in Girls' Sports Act would have required both public schools and the nonpublic schools that compete against them to separate sports teams based on the team members' sex assigned at birth. Similar legislation has been introduced since 2022.\nThe General Assembly turned away a bill to allow \"X\" as a sex designation on birth certificates for transgender and nonbinary individuals.\nCNS reporters Rachel McCrea, Emma Tufo, Sasha Allen, Paul Kiefer, Adriana Navarro and Jack Bowman also contributed to this piece. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is exactly the kind of project we've been talking about. It really fits in the central business district,\" said planning commission member Paul Weber.Weber recommended landscaping for the small portion of the property fronting to West Street - a condition that was included as part of the commission's motion to approve the sketch site plan.Mullaney said the developer would also consider the planning commission's comments on windows and defining the base of the building. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TOWN OF EASTON\n \nA rendering shows the proposed design of a newly approved live-work building at 123 South Washington Street in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Marine fishery insider explains rockfish decision\n\n January 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Maryland officials are standing firm with Atlantic coast partners in their mission to rebuild striped bass (rockfish) populations by 2029 despite pushback from local fishing industry leaders over current restrictions.The Atlantic State Marine Fishery Commission voted Dec. 16 to maintain existing recreational fishing regulations for 2025, with only Maine and New Hampshire opposing.\n\"The stakes would be too high\" to abandon interstate cooperation, said Maryland Department of Natural Resources Associate Director Mark Luisi, responding to industry calls for Maryland to establish its own commission. The decision affects fishing limits across multiple states from Virginia to Delaware.\nLuisi, a native of south New Jersey, has been working at the governor's office for 25 years now, and is a board member on the ASMFC, sitting as the proxy on the administrative side under Lynn Waller Fegley, DNR director, Fishing and Boating Services.\nServing alongside Luisi, are governor appointee Russell Dize, a certified licensed captain from Tilghman, and Maryland Delegate Dana Stein and proxies David Sikorski, executive director of Coastal Conservation Association Maryland and Allison Colden, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nCapt. Rob Newberry, chairman of the Atlantic Fishing Association, challenged the commission's data collection methods, particularly for recreational fishing. He praised Maryland's three-tier commercial tracking system but argued recreational catches lack similar oversight.\nHis emboldened message to the ASMFC was \"leave us alone,\" in hopes Maryland would establish their own fishery commission, breaking from the compact of Atlantic states formed in 1942 by Congress.\nNewberry was not satisfied with the decision from ASMFC, claiming they were kicking the \"can down the road,\" then called in question the reliability of their recording methods which will determine how many fish anglers catch in 2026.\nLuisi emphasized there are no plans for Maryland to abandon the ASMFC. He said the stakes would be too high, and too many states depend on the organization. What affects Virginia, for example also affects neighbors, Delaware and Maryland and so on.\nSo, since breaking from ASMFC is not an option, Luisi said he strives for accuracy and understanding, hearing concerns from stakeholders as they move to the goal of rebuilding the stock (Atlantic striped bass, or rockfish population) by 2029.\nLuisi defended the commission's approach, noting that rockfish's status as the East Coast's most popular sport fish — with over 200,000 recreational anglers — provides reliable data through dock surveys.\n\"It just provides an estimate,\" Luisi said, \"and I'm pretty confident of the numbers we get in rockfish.\"\nThe commission uses computer modeling similar to weather forecasting to predict mortality rates. Their latest assessment found waters \"slightly overfished,\" leading to last year's limit of one rockfish per person.\nAccording to Luisi, to control population levels, regulators can only:\nLimit or close seasons.\nSet size limits.\nControl the number of fish that can be kept.\n\"Outside of that, such as environmental factors affecting population, we can't control effort,\" Luisi concluded.\nDespite Newberry's claims, Luisi insisted these regulations are not there to hurt the fishing industry. On the contrary, the surveys encourage fishers to be \"right in the middle\" of the decision-making process.\nThe commission will decide on further action at their October meeting, following eight months of stakeholder discussions. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Simplify your Baking: Quick bread basics for beginners\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maike Corbett Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Making bread at home intimidates many home bakers who don't have tons of experience making yeast bread. Several steps are involved, and there's no guarantee of an edible end result. Plus, making bread is time-consuming. That's probably part of the reason why the global bakery market is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, according to 360iResearch.It's convenient for shoppers with busy schedules to grab a loaf of bread or another pre-packaged bakery item. They're available in every grocery store, reasonably inexpensive, and the quality is consistent. However, home cooks who like to know what's in their food may still want to try their hand creating their own baked goods. Quick bread is an excellent solution to that dilemma.\nWhat Is Quick Bread?\nQuick bread is a type of bread that does not use yeast or another biological agent for leavening. These goods include pancakes, waffles, zucchini bread, banana bread, American biscuits, Southern cornbread, and more. This category also includes flatbreads like naan or tortillas.\nAccording to the Wheat Foods Council, quick breads became more popular during the mid-19th century, when baking soda and baking powder came on the market. After the Civil War started, home cooks needed bread recipes that didn't require several hours to let yeast doughs rise. The result was what we now know as quick bread.\nAmerican biscuits are one of the earliest types of quick breads, although making them before the Civil War wasn't quick. Since yeast was hard to find and expensive, bakers kneaded the dough to incorporate enough air into it so it would rise when baked. Baking powder makes the process much easier.\nWhy Quick Bread?\nQuick breads don't have to rise, and the dough doesn't always need to be kneaded. Quick bread recipes are usually easy. Since they don't require specialized techniques, they're great for beginners, including kids. Most quick bread recipes are \"dump and stir.\"\nMaking a quick bread is a good way to learn several basic cooking techniques, including correctly measuring and sifting flour. The loaves don't have to be shaped, either. The cook only needs to pour the batter into a greased baking pan.\nQuick breads yield consistent results. If the person follows the recipe, the results should come out well. It's hard to mess up quick bread. Another reason these are great starter recipes.\nQuick breads are also versatile. The recipes are forgiving; cooks can add different ingredients to suit their family's preferences. For example, if no one likes walnuts, the cook can add pecans to banana bread or omit the nuts entirely. They can also add chocolate chips or even dried blueberries or cranberries for a different take on the bread.\nAnna Chesley, with Salt in My Coffee, says, \"I make a lot of quick breads, and our favorites vary with the seasons. In spring, we love rhubarb quick bread, topped with a maple streusel crumble. In the summer months, we go through a lot of zucchini bread, and by late fall, we're so ready for cranberry orange bread — our favorite through the cold weather months.\"\nThose with a bumper crop of zucchini in their gardens often make zucchini bread in the summer. They may also try pumpkin bread if they have a pumpkin in the garden. It's a good way to use surplus vegetables so they don't go to waste.\nHealthier Choices\nIf people are concerned about gluten in their food, eat a plant-based menu, or have other dietary concerns, quick breads are a viable option. You may think quick breads are sugary and carb-heavy, but that's not always true. The best part of making a quick bread is that the cook controls the ingredients. There are low-sugar recipes and low-carb options that incorporate almond flour or another lower-carb flour to lower the carbohydrate count.\n\"We make whole food plant based oil free banana bread with dairy free chocolate chips,\" says Jacqueline Sanchez of My Plant Based Plan. \"It's a great breakfast with a side of fruit and coffee or an afternoon snack after school for the kids.\"\nQuick breads aren't necessarily loaves, either. Flatbreads are quick and a popular alternative to the standard white sandwich bread. Tiffany McCauley with The Gracious Pantry says, \"My favorite is Socca, a chickpea flatbread. It's super quick and easy to make and is totally gluten-free. It tastes great and even works as a pizza crust. I use it that way often and love it.\"\nFor those who don't have time to work with yeast bread, making quick bread is a good way to have savory or sweet baked goods that can be served for any meal.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ronald Odom, an Elkton Police Department detective who also serves as an agency spokesman. Odom also reported that one of the suspects pepper-sprayed the victim.\nThe attempted armed robbery occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on Wednesday in the Walmart Supercenter parking lot in the 1000 block of East Pulaski Highway (Route 40), police said. At the time, the employee was in a section of the parking lot that is closest to the Chick-Fil-A while servicing an ATM machine, police added.\nAn ambulance crew transported the woman from the scene to ChristianaCare Union Hospital in Elkton, where she was treated for minor injuries and then discharged, police reported.\nBased on the preliminary investigation, detectives believe that the culprits approached the employee in that parking lot and tried to force her to open a compartment in the armored vehicle where the money is stored, according to Odom.\nAt some point during the attempted robbery, one of the suspects pepper-sprayed the woman, who was unable to oblige her assailants' demand to unlock the compartment, Odom reported.\n\"She was not able to open the locked section because, for security reasons, there are procedures in place. It's not as easy as unlocking your car,\" Odom explained.\nOdom described the three assailants only as black men and noted that one of them brandished \"an AK mini Draco style pistol that looks like an assault rifle.\"\nHe further reported that the culprits fled from the scene in a dark-colored sport utility vehicle that is similar to a Dodge Durango or a Chevrolet Tahoe — with tinted windows and a white license plate — and that the getaway vehicle was last seen heading east on Route 40 into Delaware.\nInvestigators believe that the assailants were concerned that law enforcement officers might be rushing to the scene, which prompted them to abandon their efforts to break into the armored vehicle and flee instead, police reported.\nEPD investigators watched video that they gleaned from security cameras in the area where the attempted armed robbery occurred, Odom said. They also interviewed witnesses, Odom added, declining to elaborate because of the ongoing investigation.\nAfter receiving notification about the attempted robbery resulting in an injured employee, Brink sent representatives to the scene and they removed the armored vehicle, police reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the Maryland Department of Aging calculated how those may be allocated to counties, Talbot faced the potential of losing $24,000 in funding this year, Ottey noted.\n\"Since we're already pretty much spent through quarter three, that would be really drastic cuts in quarter four of this year,\" Ottey said. \" … We'd have to cut off almost all of our services to our seniors in the last quarter of this year if these cuts were to go through.\"\nOttey said that state legislators are pushing for a reduction in total cuts, potentially from the $2.5 million mark to around $900,000. The trimming comes as the state is faced with an over $3 billion deficit.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said senior care is the \"wrong place to find those savings.\"\nCouncil member Lynn Mielke denounced the potential cuts and noted Talbot County's higher-than-average age makes such funding even more crucial.\nAccording to census data, people 65-and-over accounts for 30% of Talbot County's total population. The county's average age was 50.9 in 2023 and has slightly increased each year since 2020. The national average is just under 39 years old.\n\"I think it's disgraceful what this state has done in this regard, and find it to be really ageist,\" Mielke said.\n\"Hopefully the state legislature will wake up and do the right thing by its senior citizens, who have supported them all these years,\" she later added.\nOttey said the county's senior care program has served 214 clients this year already, up from 207 last year. \"People are needing us now more than ever,\" she said.\nJennifer Marchi, vice chair of Talbot County's commission on aging, said depending on how the cuts shake out, they may return to the council at a future date with a request for up to $24,000 in contingency funding.\nTuesday, the County Council voted 4-0 to write a letter of support for senior care program funding. Council members thanked Ottey and Marchi, along with senior care leaders and workers in attendance, for their work.\n\"You've done a fabulous job at providing services,\" Mielke said.\n\"And we also know that there are senior homeless issues that are going to have to be addressed,\" she continued. \"And how are they going to be addressed if they cut back our funding for what we're already providing? It's a tragic situation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

When she was about 5 years old, after continuously begging for a horse, her mother made her a promise. If she could raise $2,500, then she could have a horse.\nTanglao went door-to-door in her neighborhood for over four years and took any job she could. From shoveling snow to raking leaves, she was determined to have her horse. Then, at the age of 9, she brought a pillowcase filled with cash to her mother, who had completely forgotten the promise, and finally got her horse.\nEbony, Tanglao's first horse, was mean and a biter. He was forced out of horse school for bad behavior. Yet, she loved this ill-mannered horse and found joy in caring for him every day.\nFrom there on, her love for horses grew. She got another horse and another.\n\"I think they're just like my will to live,\" Tanglao said. \"There's something about them that's just part of my soul. I love them.\"\nOriginally from Lexington, Virginia, she learned of horse-drawn carriage tours in the area and begged the local business for a job over the course of years. Finally, they gave her a job that she loved. There, she decided to one day have her own horse-drawn carriage business.\nToday, Tanglao has 11 carriages, ten horses and acres to help teach people how to lead a horse-drawn carriage.\nJessie Willey, owner of Alternative Therapy, said that Tanglao's love for horses is striking to anyone who meets her, and her work ethic knows no bounds.\n\"Jessica's passion is evident through the happiness of her horses,\" Wiley said. \"I've never met a group of horses more excited to work. Jess puts her heart and soul into her horses and her business. Rain or shine … or snow, she'll be out at the barn taking care of her best friends. Her knowledge about the horse and carriage is a gift to the rapidly growing community.\"\nTanglao says doing carriage rides allows her to entertain and bring joy to all her customers. Putting on a show and making her customers laugh is what makes this job worth it.\nHer two children, both under the age of 6, share the same passion for horses. Tanglao said her children saw her around horses, and soon, their love for them became infectious.\nNow, her daughter Millie Tanglao is interested in driving horses and being around her pony, JamJam.\nWhile leading her pony to enjoy some grass, Millie shared what she loved most about horses, which included being around them, especially when they were sniffing her.\nTanglao says it's important to encourage young people's interest in animals, especially regarding activities with animals. She shared that it is uncanny how much her daughter reminds her of herself as a child. They both share the same determined love for horses.\nTanglao hopes to share her love for horses with everyone and show young girls that being driven and believing in themselves can result in achieving their dreams.\n\"I tell my daughter all the time that the words 'I can't' don't exist,\" Tanglao said. \"If you want something and you want to do something, figure it out. You can figure it out. Look at all the women who have figured it out before us. Just keep going and keep the dream alive.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot County Council approves purchase of Poplar Hill Farm\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An unsuspecting item on the Talbot County Council's Tuesday evening meeting agenda yielded a significant surprise — the council's unanimous approval for the county to purchase Poplar Hill Farm.Placed on the agenda as a nonspecific request from the county manager to approve a contract of sale to acquire property, the request asked the council to agree to purchase the 120-acre property for $6 million.\nThe newly approved purchase will take the long-proposed Poplar Hill housing development off the table.\nThe property is slated for future county use, including preservation of open space in the critical area, according to County Manager Clay Stamp.\nThe property is bounded to the north by Route 333 (Oxford Road) and to the southeast by Route 322 (Easton Bypass). It's near the Easton Club development, the small Papermill Crossing community and 197 acres owned by the Town of Easton for the Easton Woodland Park.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan said the council began the process of looking into the opportunity to purchase the property in mid- to late December.\nThe land was appraised in January, listing with a market value of $6,990,000, Stamp said. Funding for the acquisition will come from the county's fiscal year 2024 capital project enabling legislation, which authorized the county to spend up to $6.1 million on property for county purposes.\nStamp called the council's action to acquire the property \"visionary,\" saying it opens up possibilities to address future needs, including facilities and open space. It also maintains critical areas.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said the previous County Council had eyed a piece of the property for future county facilities, of which there is a \"huge need.\" The property's acreage and proximity to downtown Easton also made it a key purchase.\n\"I think that this is a really significant and unique opportunity, and I want to express my gratitude for the sellers for approaching us with this opportunity,\" he said. \"This is a really, really significant deal.\"\nOne possibility for the site is future county schools, Lesher said after the meeting.\n\"This leaves the county in the driver's seat for that kind of decision,\" he said.\nOriginal plans for the property, currently owned by 5001 SHR L.C., were a source of concern for Talbot County residents last year when a developer proposed turning the parcel into a mixed-use development with 456 residential units.\nMost concerns stemmed from the developer's request for a critical area growth allocation to reclassify just over half of the property from a resource conservation area to an intensely developed area due to its location within the town's critical area.\nThe critical area is land within 1,000 feet of Maryland's tidal waters and tidal wetlands.\nThe application for the 456-unit development was rescinded last August. A sketch plan for a smaller 119-unit subdivision in the same location was conditionally approved by the Easton Planning Commission in September.\nCallahan said the opportunity to purchase the property was a decision the county would be proud of for years to come.\n\"It's phenomenal,\" he said. \"It's something that we're all going to be proud of, and I'm glad this council chose to do that, that's for sure.\"\nThis story may be updated as information becomes available. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Arts \n \n 438\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — The \"Science of Photography\" as captured by the artist's eye will be on full display for those who appreciate what is revealed through the camera and life's lens when a new exhibit opens in Chestertown on Wednesday, July 3.The exhibition, which runs through Aug. 28 in the interior public areas of the Heron Point Retirement Community, will display the works of seven talented photographers who have a knack for chronicling the exquisite beauty and inherent charm associated with living in and among the environs and the inhabitants of what is known as the Delmarva.\nBarbara Finneson, a representative of Heron Point's Art Interest Group, said she is personally very excited to view the work of this particular collective of artists. \"This is a special group,\" she said, noting that it is based in Salisbury, and includes the works of Mike Morris, Libby Morris, Kenneth Jones, Tony Burton, Latoya Drummond, Samuel Everett and Seldon Dix.\nThis group of photographic professionals and friends has been known to do whatever it takes, whether that means chasing 3 a.m. sunrises, enduring bitter cold, or patiently waiting for just the right light and conditions to evolve, to get the perfect shot.\n\"These Delmarva artists,\" according to the statement provided by the Art Interest Group, \"…are dedicated to capturing the unique beauty and essence of Delmarva through their lens. Their collection of work showcases the diverse landscapes, vibrant communities, and rich cultural heritage of the region, applying their individual perspectives and artistic styles. They create a fresh and innovative approach to documenting the natural wonders and human stories of Maryland's Eastern Shore.\"\nFinneson, who is a 20-year resident of Heron Point, said her community always has the good fortune to have artistic works on display in its common areas by talented resident artists and others from the community at-large. Heron Point residents, she said, are oftentimes so inspired by what they see in these exhibitions, they have been known to start painting for the first time at the age of 80, and they particularly look forward to these special collections.\nWhile the opening will take place on July 3 at 10 a.m., the artists themselves will be on-hand for a special gathering on the afternoon on Sunday, July 14 from 2 to 4 p.m. to speak to visitors about their creative process. The community is encouraged to come and participate in the discussion.\nThis exhibition will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. from June 3 through Aug. 28, with many works available for purchase.

    "content": "Lions, Bucs, Warriors ready to duel for North title\n\n September 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1372\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The scores are always close, and there's a tendency to go beyond the standard time limit.That was last year's formula when the Easton, Kent Island and Queen Anne's County High field hockey teams played each other.\nThe Lions pulled out a regular-season victory over Easton that was decided after two overtimes in a 1v1 duel. Queen Anne's capped the regular-season slate by tying Kent Island in another 1v1 showdown, then edged the Bucs 1-0 for a second consecutive Class 2A East Region I title. The Warriors also managed to beat the Bucs by a one-goal difference in overtime.\nThat pattern continued Monday afternoon, as Kent Island opened its season by defeating Easton 2-1 in overtime, setting up what should again be a hotly contested battle for the North Bayside crown.\n\"As long as they stay healthy I think we've got a good shot,\" said Queen Anne's head coach Shana Corder, whose team will bid for a third consecutive Bayside Conference championship and look to make another deep postseason run after reaching the Class 2A state semifinals last year.\n\"I really feel like we're picking up where we left off,\" said Easton head coach Kim Neff, whose team went into overtime or beyond five times last season, which ended with a loss in the 2A state semifinals.\n\"I'm just very, very excited,\" Kent Island head coach Laura Harding said. \"Hopefully we go far in the playoffs. I have high expectations for our team.\"\nShe's not the only one.\nIn addition to Queen Anne's, Kent Island and Easton's title aspirations, Saints Peter and Paul is positioned to take aim at a fourth straight Eastern Shore Independent Athletic Conference championship.\n\"As long as we play our game we should be pretty solid,\" head coach Debbie McQuaid said.\nHere's a look at this year's teams:\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Kim Neff.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Taylor Bowen (So.); Aniya Caldwell (Sr.); Defense: Alden Gibbons-Neff (So.); Adeline Moore (Jr.); Sammy Townsend (Sr.); Hannah Dahlen (Jr.); Macy Graves (So.); Kadence McGuckin (Sr.); Midfield: Stella Kabler (Sr.); Addison Knox (Jr.); Ryann Quicke (Jr.); Juju Willey (So.); Forwards: Georgia Spies (Jr.); McKenna Clow (Jr.); Cali Quinto (Jr.); Lily Tiebosch (So.); Sunny Chandler (So.); Sloane Gunshenan (Fr.).\nOutlook: The Warriors graduated five seniors from last year's 12-4 team, including leading scorer Olivia Orrell.\nThe bulk of that team returns though, and has opened the season with a pair of nail-biters, edging Parkside 2-1 on the final play of regulation Friday before Monday's 2-1 loss in OT to Kent Island.\n\"I feel we have the girls that have stepped in to fill the void for the seniors,\" Neff said. \"One thing I'm really excited about, our forwards are a little bit more eager and hungry for scoring. That's always been a weakness of ours.\"\nThe defense again looks tough with Bowen back in goal.\nKENT COUNTY\nHead Coach: Suzie Wright-Taylor.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Miley Mincey (Fr.); Defense: Taylor Strong (Jr.); Jane Cleary (Jr.); Aiyanna Copper (So.); Tess Fuchs (Sr.); Abigail Parr (Fr.); Midfield: Abby Gallo (So.); Eliza Loller (Jr.); Audri Manning (Fr.); Catherine Gerstung (So.); Forwards: Nevaeh Blackiston (So.); Keelyn Clayton (Fr.); Mackensie Egolf (Fr.); Grace Gerstung (Sr.); McKenna Messick (Sr.); Mali Wirth (So.).\nOutlook: Numbers are up for the Trojans. Mincey has never played goalie before, but Wright-Taylor likes her instincts. Cleary, a first-year player who comes over from soccer, will team with Strong and Copper in hopes of providing a solid defense.\nGallo's return at midfield is a huge asset while Clayton hopes to provide some punch up front.\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Laura Harding.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Brynja Petursson (Jr.); Defense: Emma Wackowski (Sr.); Kai Moore (Jr.); Alice Phelan (Jr.); Laura Peck (Sr.); Rita Yost (Sr.); Lyla Bailey (Sr.); Chloe Rankin (Jr.); Midfield: Lilly Snyder (Jr.); Lily Darr (So.); Finley Davidson (Jr.); Claire O'Keefe (Jr.); Audrey Fleshman (Jr.); Hailey Offutt (So.); Forwards: Willow Yost (Sr.); Grace Mathews (So.); Parker Tengwall (Jr.); Abby Dermer (So.); Anna Fronczek (Sr.); Vivienne Phillips (Jr.); Ally Wood (Sr.).\nOutlook: Harding was anxious to get the season started knowing she returned most of her starters from last year's 9-4-1 team. She became more stoked with the arrival of St. Mary's transfer Finley Davidson.\n\"They all play club,\" Harding said of her starting unit that looks to have plenty of depth behind it. \"They all play for the same club year-round, so it's just nice. I have a lot of girls that are hockey players.\"\nThe Bucs' solid start — a 2-1 win over Winston Churchill in a tournament Saturday and Monday's 2-1 victory over Easton — has only boosted optimism.\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: Molly Elliott.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Mady Jones (Jr.); Defense: Abby Jones (Sr.); Brooklynn Spencer (Sr.); Ashlynn Bisesi (Jr.); Midfield: Kylie Ogden (Sr.); Reece Bisesi (Sr.); Cera Fimbres (Sr.); Forwards: Julia White (So.); Jamie Robey (So.); Gracie Faulkner (Sr.); Jenna Hurley (Sr.).\nOutlook: Six of the seven starting seniors have been with Elliott all four years. Entering her third year as head coach, Elliott plans to move her players around the field this season instead of setting them up in one area game after game.\n\"Our goal is to build up their confidence and operate as one whole unit, as opposed to just, 'This is the forward line and this is what your job is.'\" Elliott said. \"'This is the midfield and this is what your job is.' We're going to have a lot of players who play in different positions throughout the season. I want them to end this season proud of everything they've done over the last four seasons because they have truly worked hard.\"\nQUEEN ANNE'S\nHead Coach: Shana Corder.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Caroline Kimball (Sr.); Lilah Kennedy (So.); Defense: Kaylee Webster (Fr.); Sydnie Harris (Sr.); Abby Woodfield (So.); Mel Gill (So.); Midfield: Haley Cole (Sr.); Loralye LaClair (So.); Ella Rebstock (Jr.); Jordan Bilbo (Sr.); Forwards: Ella Napier (Sr.); Izzy King (So.).\nOutlook: The Lions are again retooling their defense, but the return of Gill in the back and Kimball between the pipes are two big reasons why the defending champions once again have shots at multiple titles.\nTo be completely honest, I'm surprised at my preseason and how well we've done because I lost a lot,\" Corder said. \"Every week I'm like, 'OK, this is going to be my test and we're going to see how good we are.' And they keep doing well.\"\nQueen Anne's blanked Delmar over the weekend and opened their season Monday with a 9-0 rout of Holly Grove.\nIn addition to Kimball and Gill, Cole — who is headed to James Madison University — and Bilbo — who is bound for Shippensburg — make Queen Anne's tough to dethrone.\n\"We're leaning on our leaders,\" Corder said. \"But they've got to stay healthy.\"\nST. MICHAELS\nHead Coach: Karen Hopkins.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Olivia Patrick (Sr.); Defense: Rebecca Martinez (Sr.); Ella Marr (So.); Jordyn Beckett (Jr.); Georgia Crow (Jr.); Midfield: Tess Weller (Sr.); Addison Andrews (Fr.); Vivian Longenecker (Fr.); Evelyn Mautz (So.); Forwards: Kayla Montoya-Guzman (Sr.); Abby Fisher (Jr.); Zoe Cerrato (So.); Penny Turner (So.).\nOutlook: Five freshmen transferred out, but Hopkins has been encouraged by two who have stayed, Andrews and Longenecker, and thinks both have the potential to make an impact this season and beyond. Weller, who along with Martinez and Mautz, is a captain, rounds out the midfield.\n\"The energy and commitment from this group have us optimistic for what's ahead,\" Hopkins said. \"We're looking forward to growing our program.\"\nGUNSTON\nHead Coach: Yvonne Gazelle.\nReturners: Layla Kent (Sr.); Gabrielle Shepherd (Jr.); Kate Zottarelli (Jr.); Izzy Labrador (So.); Genevieve Baughman (Sr.); Lila McDermott (So.).\nOutlook: The graduation of Grace Shepherd will hurt, but Gabrielle Shepherd and Kent are two of the area's top players and figure to have the Herons challenging for a fourth consecutive trip to the ESIAC championship game.\nSAINTS PETER & PAUL\nHead Coach: Debbie McQuaid.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Pyper Mister (So.); Kaila Davis (Sr.); Defense: Lucy Rankin (Sr.); Kenzie Foster (Jr.); Reagan Wolters (So.); Julia Spero (Jr.); Bridget Gilman (Jr.); Midfield: Angie Webb (Jr.); Sadie Jacobs (So.); Caroline Corson (Fr.); Forwards: Kiera Crossed (So.); Kate Sweeney (Jr.); Jules Stepp (Sr.); Bella Jancoska (Fr.); Chloe Rehbein (Fr.); Maddison Mahoney (Fr.).\nOutlook: The Sabres will push for a fourth consecutive ESIAC championship — and a fifth in six years.\nSts. Peter & Paul appears to be strong in all areas, with Rankin anchoring the defense, Webb returning at midfield along with Corson, and Stepp — who is headed to Salisbury — and Sweeney up top. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent Samaritan Group nears goal to open emergency shelter in December\n\n October 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — On Sunday afternoon, the day of its fundraising rally at Presbyterian Church of Chestertown, the Samaritan Group of Kent County had $1,400 toward its goal of $14,000 needed to open the Emergency Winter Shelter, in operation since 2003.Because of Christ First United Methodist Church's $5,000 donation, along with other donations, at the end of the event that afternoon, the group had $12,000.\nShelter Director the Rev. James Diggs said they need donations and are optimistic to reach the goal, but they also need volunteers for the shelter: some cooks, but more importantly they need hosts and sleepers. The host, Diggs explained, meets and greets the guests, ensures they are comfortable and safe while the sleepers stay the whole night.\nDiggs announced this year they are aiming to open the shelter in December, a first.\nThat is up to the amount of volunteers that sign up. Diggs said that they have to have 85% of December filled to accomplish this, with volunteers especially needed Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's.\n\"Let's make this month a recruiting month. Help us do it because I think we certainly can. We're excited to be able to add December and maybe next year, add another month.\"\nAs winter approaches, the need increases to care for Kent County's homeless population he stated.\nAs their mission describes, the Samaritan Group of Kent County work with local agencies, churches, businesses and organizations and individuals to keep them warm and also providing financial assistance.\nDuring the rally with refreshments and ice cream served by Marcia Stoltzfus and family, Diggs listed the shelter's accomplishments and gave out certificates and awards to the hardworking, caring volunteers which make it possible each year, adding a fun family event along the fundraising.\nIn the early winter months of 2025, they served 21 clients, seven women, two children and 12 men, 661 bed nights total. In 2018 they served 21 people as well, 1,033 bed nights and that next year, 28 people and 921 bed nights.\n\"The number of people we serve is unpredictable. We just don't know from year to year. The point is to be ready and all of you volunteers make that possible.\"\nHe thanked some of the volunteers that helped get the shelter ready.\nReceiving the Laverne and Shirley Award was dynamic duo Annie Woodall and Andrea Nieman. Top Chef, and also supplying that tasty soft serve ice cream was Marcia Stoltzfus and family. The Host with the Most was Allison Brieske and Volunteer of the Year, who dedicated time cooking/ inspiring her whole church to cook, and hosting, was Anne-Marie Walters.\nMany other certificates given as well, some of whom were not in attendance.\n\"They may not be here, but they were when it counted,\" joked Diggs.\nGiving her testimony about the rewards of volunteering was Melanie Keller, who was recruited by Woodall and Nieman years back and was the volunteer coordinator for a time.\nKeller said that after her third child, part of what kept her volunteering was her two children who also volunteer. They play hide-and-seek with guests and see other people's experiences, their suffering and joys and practice reaching out with compassion.\n\"We are a community and I hope to see some of you as hosts,\" she told attendees.\nDiggs said hosts have a very important role, stay from 5:30-10 p.m. and are in pairs. Diggs personally greets the hosts each night and briefs them on what they need to know, ensuring they are comfortable.\nSleepers stay into the night and see guests off in the morning.\nDiggs encouraged the audience to not only sign up but to become recruits, sharing the joys of volunteering at the shelter where Mid-Shore Community Foundation, United Way of Kent County, the Good Neighbor Fund and Kent County Department of Social Services partner in this important mission.\n\"We need your help,\" Diggs said to the community. \"With it we can open up in December...one month at a time.\"\nTo contact them go to: info@samaritangroupofkentcounty.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'It's about the JOURNEY' - Retired Marine Capt. Mike Oldham takes on the Pacific Crest Trail\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1451\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE - Mike Oldham loves hiking.It's a hobby he picked up as a young Marine in California, but the formidable Pacific Crest Trail beckoned him once he retired. After months of planning and preparing, he launched his odyssey last year.When an injury sidetracked him, he left the trail, but resumed his trek a year later.On Sept. 3, he completed his over 2,550-mile hike with an emotional coda he recorded on YouTube, a platform he used to record many of the highs and lows of his journey, along with his philosophical musings.Mike Oldham, 60, of Centreville, credits his 26-year career as a U.S.Marine for helping him prepare and especially, to apply an all-important lesson: Carry plenty of water.He's not sure if his ability to plan and prepare is innate or was formed as part of his Marine experience and persona, but it was probably a combination of both.Oldham recalled his service in the Marine Corps, his childhood that propelled his love of the trail, the arduous training, the toll the hike took on his body and the sublime moments that took his breath away.A LOVE OF HIKING IS BORNOldham grew up in Roseville, Michigan, spending time on his grandparents' farm and tramping their 15 acres of woods.\"I just love being out in the woods. I loved hiking,\" he said. \"My brother likes hunting and I tried to hunt, but I didn't like it as much as just walking around the woods. I thought it was great.\" In high school, Oldham \"concentrated on football and girls, and I got a 100% scholarship to the United States Marine Corps\" in 1981, he said.That decision landed him in a first tour of duty that was \"very fortunate.\" As a Sikorsky CH-53 Helicopter mechanic and crew chief, he was stationed with newly elected President Ronald Reagan's helicopter squadron Marine One.\"We would fly into the White House and pick them up or take them to Andrews Air Force Base,\" Oldham said. \"And then when he was overseas, we would break down our helicopters and put them in a C-5, go overseas and put them together and pick them up at whatever airport.\" Oldham has since visited the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and viewed a photograph of himself with Reagan that's hanging on the wall in Air Force One.He remembers the late president as a person \"as genuine as you could imagine. He was truly the guy that you saw on TV,\" he said.He eventually went to warrant officer school, served a series of assignments and retired with the rank of captain after 26 years.\"I got a great job at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, and I worked in support of the MQ-1 Predator and the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles,\" he said. During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they were the UAVs \"dropping bombs and killing bad guys.\" He retired from General Atomics on March 29, 2022, and two days later he started hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.\"I was ready for a break from aerospace and everything,\" Oldham said. \"You go through life 100 miles an hour, and this was the way to get away from everything and just enjoy God's country.\"FOREST BATHING\"Forest bathing,\" a form of ecotherapy, is something Oldham has come to appreciate and advocate.Whether \"in the desert, the mountains or forests, it helps you psychologically, and there is nothing better than being away from everything - no cell phones, no cars, no roads, no email, nothing. Just you and the trail,\" he said.The PCT is one of three long distance hiking trails in the U.S. \"They don't have these trails in other countries,\" Oldham said. \"We're very fortunate to have these national parks and these trails.\" As he \"started romancing and fantasizing\" about hiking one of these trails, he took a \"deep dive into the history of (long distance hiking) and researching and watching other people's videos about it\" for about five years.The PCT captured his imagination.Near his home and work, Oldham had hiked in the mountains near San Diego. A year before he launched out on the PCT, he began hiking seven or eight miles after work, carrying 25 pounds of water. On weekends, he'd hike twice as far.Still, the PCT is arduous on the best of days. In fact, long-distance hikers must apply for one or more permits.There are also campfire, campsite and \"weather window\" restrictions.Besides all-essential water, Oldham equipped himself with a small Garmin inReach GPS satellite communicator for unlimited texting and emergency notification. An app called Far Out \"works in airplane mode and shows you exactly where you are and where the trail is,\" he said, and he never got lost. For treacherous walking on snow and ice, he strapped microspikes on his boots. He wore out a pair of hiking boots about every 400 miles.\"You get to eat as horrible as you want, because you're losing weight,\" Oldham said. \"You're literally at a 1,000-calorie deficit a day, and you're still eating like crazy. I lost 25 pounds, and I did not have 25 pounds to lose. When I got back, I was so weak in the upper body.Now, legs-wise, you're climbing 4,000 to 5,000 feet a day with a 30-pound pack, and you are crushing it, but your upper body is taking a toll.\" Still, rather than push himself beyond his physical limits, he did what he jokingly called the \"Oregon resort challenge,\" seeking out RV resorts that had food, beer and places to recharge battery packs. If the weather forecast called for several days of heavy rain, Oldham would opt to stay at a nearby hostel or hotel.Oldham's trail name became \"Marine Mike\" after a hiker finally caught up with him after five days, bearing the hat Oldham had lost. His brother David had given him the hat that identified Oldham as a Marine. \"I've been chasing you for five days,\" the hiker gasped. \"How can an old man hike so fast?\" Oldham embarked from the southern terminus in Campo, California, on the Mexico border March 31, 2022, and made it to Lake Tahoe. Although he had experienced some hard falls and broken packs all along the trek, on June 16, he landed in the emergency room with foot and knee injuries he sustained on the trail at 1,100 miles.\"Welcome to the PCT,\" he quipped.SIDELINED, BUT BACK ON THE TRAILHe spent the rest of the year in physical therapy, and ventured back into the gym.Oldham got back on the trail June 15, 2023, at mile 1,236 in Quincy, California, a year minus a day from his exit in 2022.According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association, California comprises the lion's share of miles at 1,692. The PCT in Oregon is 455 miles long and Washington is 506 miles.The vistas on the trail were worth the effort, Oldham said. \"The Sierra Mountains were just amazing,\" he said.He climbed Mount Whitney - at 14,505 feet, the highest mountain in the contiguous U.S. and the Sierra Nevada.\"You definitely feel the low oxygen, (but) the views are just amazing. You think you're in a National Geographic film all day long.Also the state of Washington is just gorgeous. I mean, gorgeous.\" From freezing temperatures to scorching heat or gale-force winds, from heavy snowfall to treacherous snow to fallen trees, sheer slopes, rocks, desert and rivers - and even a stubborn bull blocking the trail - Oldham encountered the gamut of terrain, weather and obstacles.But \"trail angels\" and \"trail magic\" - surprising grace notes along the way - were \"a blessing to have,\" he said.\"Trail angels just truly love supporting hikers.\" \"You're out there hiking, and then you come across somebody who is cooking burgers for you or has fruit and and sodas\" or a cold drink hikers crave, he said. They even came across a cooler containing beer in the middle of the woods marked with the sign \"trail magic.\" The day Oldham reached the terminus on Sept. 3, he was filled with emotion. \"I didn't see it coming either.\" \"That was a goal that I had had for several years, and you're out there pumping 20-plus miles a day all to reach this goal,\" Oldham said.\"But it wasn't about the destination because the destination was a bunch of wood stuck in the ground. It was about the journey. You know, our life is about the journey.It's not about the destination.\" While Oldham remains an always faithful Marine, he carries with him the indelible memory of his odyssey that pushed him to his limits in the Great Outdoors.To see videos of his trek, visit Mike Oldham's YouTube channel at youtube.com/@mikeoldham4023. \n \n Caption: COURTESY MIKE OLDHAM\n \nMike Oldham on Mount Whitney, the highest summit in the continental United States.\n \nCOURTESY MIKE OLDHAM\n \nIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan shakes hands with young Marine Mike Oldham at Camp David. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Recovery in Motion lights candles for victims of addiction\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Saturday evening, over 50 people gathered at Fountain Park for Recovery in Motion's annual candle lighting event to recognize International Overdose Awareness Day, Aug. 31.This now annual event ushers in Recovery Month, a month where Kent Goes Purple raises awareness through purple banners and signs spread around the county.\nSpeakers that night encouraged attendees who suffer from addiction to find their higher power.\nSteve Hafferman told the audience he struggled with drugs and alcohol most of his life. Even after he overdosed, he didn't change his ways. He was homeless until he found that higher power. He said he attended a church once where most of those gathered were former addicts.\n\"For the first time, I realized I wasn't alone,\" Hafferman said.\nThat support helped him, going through the steps to recovery, experiencing something dramatically different from his family background.\nHis new faith was life-altering, but then he got into a motorcycle accident by no fault of his own.\nWhile riding in Easton on March 26 last year, a vehicle ran a light, affording him no time to stop. It was a devastating collision, his bike in shambles, his body mangled. Nineteen hours of surgery resulted in his leg being taken.\nAfter the accident, he was angry at God for allowing this to happen.\n\"I lost my gratitude,\" Hafferman said, remembering being in pain every day.\nFeeling powerless, like he couldn't even play with his kids, after five years of sobriety, he wanted to end his life. Drugs seemed to be the most effective method, he thought. He took enough cocaine to stop his heart, yet, miraculously it didn't.\nHe realized then God was not done with him.\nHafferman said, \"Failure's not when you fall, it's when you stay down.\"\nThe next speaker, Recovery in Motion peer support Bobbie Sutton, didn't stay down either.\nHer loving, musically talented older brother William Sutton IV died of a heroin overdose. Narcan, an effective medication used to treat overdoses, was not ready available as it is now, Sutton shared.\n\"He was always a such a good brother and great friend. He never treated me like a bratty sister,\" she reflected.\nIn 2009, his disappearance had sparked a year-long investigation to the dumping of his body, which furthered her pain, hurt and confusion.\nThe great loss and nature of the case threw Sutton into addiction as well, and after 11 years in that cycle, she wound up in prison for four years in Buncombe County, North Carolina.\nWith support from her mother, Phyllis Harrington, a nurse at the A.F. Whitsitt Center, and others, Sutton found her higher power in Christ and went through the steps. Subsequently, she followed in her mother's footsteps as well, helping people as a peer recovery specialist.\nShe said she's in awe of the change.\n\"I thought I would never be someone to carry titles and make a decent living. It's amazing that women come in and want to speak to me now for help,\" Sutton said.\n\"I've been able to come back home,\" she said, grateful of the people in her life, now three years clean.\nWhile others lit candles, Sutton joined her mother beside a photograph of her brother, holding the flame close, remembering his personality, his talent and his band, The Big Hurt Band.\nDirector of Community Addiction Services Jennifer McCready and Peer Supervisor Brett Forrest thanked all those in attendance. McCready mentioned for anybody who needs help for opioids or stimulants, the center has crisis beds available.\nShe gestured to the table, where cards contain the phone number of dedicated peers committed 24/7 to answering questions.\nAnd during this month, besides the purple shirts and signs, McCready noted, if you see laundry baskets placed in various sections throughout town, it's a part of the program \"2 Sheets for Recovery,\" collecting twin-sized bedding for people going into recovery housing.\nThese are all events that correspond with the theme, Kent Goes Purple, an initiative of the Kent County Sheriff's Office and the Chestertown Rotary Club.\nSheriff Dennis Hickman was also in attendance, inviting the public to join them for their 5K Color Fun Run/Walk Sunday, Sept. 8.\nHe provided a message as well during this month of reflecting and commemorating those lost to addiction as well as enforcing prevention methods. \"Law enforcement are partners in this journey to combat addiction. We're here to help in any way we can,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We bought a bag of feed yesterday and we are almost out of it,\" 4-H member Katilyn Carter said.\nCarter, 16, is showing meat goats, meat chickens, and doing herdsmen with her pony. Herdsmen entails keeping your animal at the fair all week, ensuring they are fed, watered, healthy and clean, with a corresponding informational board to educate the public and judges about your animal.\nTo prepare her meat chickens, Carter washes them two to three days before the show to ensure they have a natural oily shine. This paid off, as her chickens won first and second place ribbons at the fair over the weekend.\n\"It's going to sound really funny, but you actually blow dry them. You want them to be really fluffy…You just want them to look like little chunk balls of fluff and meat,\" said Carter about preparing her chickens for show day.\nIn showmanship competitions, you must be very knowledgeable about your animal in order to show the judges that you put in the work to be successful, according to Carter. The 4-H member must present their animal to the best of their ability, demonstrating cleanliness and knowledge on what they eat, their parts, their breed and more, said former 4-H member and long-time judge Carolyn Lawrence.\nFor meat goats, who are bred and raised to become a meal on someone's plate, the 4-H members start working with them once they are born in January or March. A few weeks later, once they're weaned from their mothers they start training them to walk with a halter and lead line, taking them on mile long walks several times a week, according to Libby Kondracki, Tails and Trails leader.\nWhen it comes to show day at the fair, Carter washes her goat in the morning and covers him to ensure he stays clean white. Since they're raised for meat, she then blow dries the animals to get them looking as fluffy as possible. According to county fair regulations, no baby powder, artificial coloring, or adhesives like hairspray can be used on the animals.\n\"The power in fitting your animal, and knowing how to fit your animal and showing your animal to make it to where you know you're showing this animal the best you can to its fullest potential. You really have to work with your goat,\" Carter said.\nBefore the fair, members get together at least twice a week and meet up as a show team and prepare together. Many of the 4-H parent leaders were 4-H members themselves when they were growing up. And many current members plan to stay involved after they age out at 18 years old to continue to give back to the community that helped shape them.\n\"I really love teaching them,\" said Carter about helping teach younger 4-H'ers. \"Because they're going to be, you know, when I'm done in two more years, they're going to be the ones that are taking over. So you really want them to be the mentor you kids that you were to them.\"\nAlthough many 4-H members compete against each other at the Cecil County Fair, they are all a team at the end of the day.\n\"When one wins, we all win,\" said Carter.\nIn addition to the camaraderie 4-H supplies, it also helps educate the public about the livestock they often consume.\nThanks to being involved in the Rising Sun 4-H Club for the past four years, Mason Gentry enjoys educating the public about his animals and their purposes. For example, he explained the importance of knowing that a Heifer is a female cow who has not been bred yet, a cow is a female cow who has been bred and had a calf, and a Steer is a male cow that's been castrated and is meant for beef.\n\"The goal of the fair is to educate the public about agriculture, give them an opportunity to see where the food comes from,\" said Mark Barczewki, 4-H Barn Stompers club leader. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Local health officials have confirmed that Maryland is currently seeing an increase in hospitalizations, which have been linked to respiratory viruses like COVID-19, influenza and RSV.\"We are surging by greater than 20% volume on any given day,\" Dr. Maxwell Ginsburg, University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center's chairman of the emergency medicine department, told Southern Maryland News. \"This includes emergency medical services arrivals and patient walk-ins. We are also seeing an increase in acuity, which essentially means that we are not only seeing more patients, but also sicker patients.\"\nThe doctor continued, \"This results in more admissions and/or transfers, which in turn results in more resource utilization throughout the whole hospital. We are consistently focused on supporting the continued flow of patients and make every attempt to see everyone as soon as possible.\"\n\"Every hospital is struggling,\" said Larisa Goganzer, senior vice president for operations at CalvertHealth Medical Center, who explained the spike is something almost predictable and likely a result of traditional holiday socializing, which often involves travel and then is brought back home and into schools when the season ends.\n\"It should start to taper off in the next couple of weeks,\" Goganzer told Southern Maryland News last week.\n\"Influenza and norovirus have had an incredible surge this winter season,\" Ginsburg said. \"We are seeing an unprecedented number of patients with complaints consistent with one or the other viruses. With regards to norovirus, the good news is that most people just need some symptomatic treatment — for example, pain medicine, nausea medicine and some IV fluids — and they feel much better and go home. The majority of our patients with the flu require the same treatment, however, we are seeing that those who did not get a flu shot have much worse and significant symptoms, sometimes resulting in admissions for more acute long-term care.\"\nALERT CODESThere is communication and coordination among hospitals and emergency medical crews and the information is available to the public via the internet.\n\"We work on the flow of patients through the building,\" Goganzer said, adding that since Christmas, CalvertHealth has been between yellow and red codes.\nAccording to Maryland's Hospital Alert Tracking System, code yellow \"is initiated because the [hospital's] emergency department is experiencing a temporary, overwhelming overload\" which can compromise the safety of managing patients classified as priority 2 and priority 3.\nGoganzer said those patients in those priority areas \"may experience longer wait times.\"\nA code red means a hospital has no electrocardiogram-monitored beds available.\n\"Red is when all of our beds are in use, we are already at full capacity,\" Goganzer said. Regardless, \"Our emergency room is always open.\"\nThe code alert system, Goganzer said, \"helps ambulances know where to take patients.\"\n\"We have several emergency code names that are called overhead to alert staff and security that there is a threat, an emergency or incoming concern,\" Ginsburg said of the system used within the La Plata hospital. \"For example, 'code blue Room 2512\" would mean that there is a respiratory emergency in room 2512, or 'code SW,' which means there is severe weather incoming or 'code red,' which means there is a fire. Each code has a unique meaning and alerts the appropriate teams into action.\"\nIn a letter to a St. Mary's County resident from that county's health department, a copy of which was forwarded to Southern Maryland News by the letter-writer, department officials attempted to allay concerns about the information from the alert system.\n\"The hospital alert you referenced is intended for EMS crews,\" the health department letter stated. \"To our understanding, they are not intended to guide the general public in making a decision to use the emergency department as a walk-in. There are many factors that influence the hospital's status, including the availability of beds and staffing, as well as how the hospital may be receiving or sending patients from and to other hospitals in their system. These status levels and contributing factors may fluctuate throughout the day.\"\n{h2 style=\"text-align: center \"}GOING TO ER{/h2}\nThe Maryland Hospital Association advises citizens \"life-threatening or conditions requiring immediate attention are prioritized in emergency rooms.\"\nThose conditions include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest or upper belly pain or pressure lasting two minutes or more, fainting, sudden dizziness, weakness, changes in vision, confusion or changes in mental status, any sudden or severe pain, uncontrolled bleeding, severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea, coughing or vomiting blood, suicidal or homicidal feelings, difficulty speaking, or numbness or weakness in any part of your body, unusual belly pain, poisoning, drug overdose, loss of consciousness, major burn, spinal cord, head, or brain injury, severe allergic reaction, a fast heartbeat (more than 120 to 150 beats per minute) at rest, especially if associated with shortness of breath or feeling faint, a broken bone with skin protruding through the skin and drowning.\nThe state hospital association advises for \"routine illnesses,\" individuals should go to their primary care provider or access \"tele-health.\"\nFor treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, individuals should visit an urgent care center.\n\"That's the place to go,\" Goganzer said of the urgent care centers located throughout the region. She added, however, that many of those facilities have experienced longer waits.\nTo visit the Maryland Hospital Association website, go to mhaonline.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A complicated matter with a lengthy history:' Lakeside resolutions remain pending\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 2194\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Although construction for the first set of homes in the Lakeside at Trappe development is well under way — and in some places, complete — project clarifications and efforts to implement county oversight remain to be done.The long-proposed and often contentious development has been the subject of numerous legislative measures since receiving approvals on its plans for wastewater treatment in the last few years.\nAnd now, even with homes already built within Lakeside's first phase, county and state officials are still attempting to clarify some aspects of the development while trying to supervise its impacts on Talbot County as a whole.\nThree pieces of county legislation, each with at least one amendment, remain pending approval from the Talbot County Council.\nTwo are waiting for a finding of consistency from the county's Planning Commission and a recommendation from the county's Public Works Advisory Board, and are set to be discussed at a joint meeting of both bodies on Wednesday, Feb. 7, at 11 a.m.\nUnder state law, the Planning Commission is required to review and certify any amendment to the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan before the Talbot County Council can adopt the measure.\nBut if the Planning Commission can't find the legislation consistent, the council will further delay an already lengthy process of replying to requests from the Maryland Department of the Environment for specific information relating to the development.\nIf adopted, the council will submit the amendments to MDE for final review and approval, fulfilling the request to address the needed information and correct mapping errors in the original legislation approving Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.\nIn January, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan acknowledged the difficulty in following the pending legislation relating to Lakeside, calling it \"a complicated matter with a lengthy history.\"\nThe council is set to hold public hearings on all three pieces of legislation at its Tuesday, Feb. 13, meeting, giving county residents an opportunity to weigh in on the unresolved measures.\nWHAT IS LAKESIDE?First proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50.\nThe property was annexed into the Town of Trappe in 2003 and approved as a planned unit development in 2006.\nOwned by Trappe East Business Holdings Trust, the development is slated to have a mix of housing types, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and a commercial and retail space.\nThe project's developer, Rocks Engineering, based in northern Virginia, is no stranger to building on the Eastern Shore. The company developed the Easton Club, a 342-unit neighborhood of single-family homes and townhouses.\nEaston-based Rauch Inc. also is working on the development.\nPassing by the site's entrance on Route 50, it's clear that construction is underway, and some homes are already lived in.\nAccording to Erin Braband, Trappe's town clerk, 114 building permits have been issued and 109 connections have been made to the town's existing wastewater treatment plant.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes.\nThat flow will eventually be diverted to a new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved in county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nRESOLUTION 281Introduced in December 2019, Resolution 281 amended the county's comprehensive plan to reclassify certain portions of the development's property for immediate priority for water and sewer service.\nIt included capital improvements — upgrading Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant from biological nutrient removal treatment to enhanced nutrient removal treatment to minimize nutrient discharge to the Chesapeake Bay, along with building a new wastewater treatment plant to serve Lakeside.\nThe new plant, set to be built with enriched nutrient removal technology, would use a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nResidents were uneasy about the then-proposed legislation, which was brought forward based on a draft permit from MDE. Concerns were voiced with water quality, health and environmental impacts and the spray irrigation system.\nBut in June 2020, the Talbot County Planning Commission found the measure to be consistent with the comprehensive plan in a 3-2 vote. And in August 2020, the Talbot County Council voted 4-1 to approve the legislation with an amendment, which split the property into two sections for differences in water and sewer classifications.\nCurrent Council Vice President Pete Lesher was the lone holdout in approving the resolution, citing concerns with connecting the first 120 homes in the development to the town's existing plant, which has been in operation since 2002, before it received an upgrade.\nMDE approved the resolution that November.\nBut in a letter sent that month, the agency told the county that Resolution 281 did not provide the number of equivalent dwelling units for the different phases of the development — information needed for further assessment.\nNo deadline was initially specified for providing the agency with that information, though a push came later.\nIn December 2020, MDE issued a final wastewater discharge permit for Lakeside's new wastewater treatment plant, approving a flow of 540,000 gallons per day — the number the developer requested in its application.\nPUBLIC OUTCRYOpposition to the fully approved wastewater discharge permit came swiftly and strongly.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit, citing concerns with spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nA form of relief came in the ShoreRivers case in late April 2021 when a Talbot County judge ruled to remand the permit to MDE to hold another public comment period.\nBut the outcry didn't stop there. In May 2021, Easton resident Dan Watson began pushing a petition calling for the council to rescind Resolution 281 without prejudice, meaning that Lakeside's developer could come back and ask for water and sewer approval again.\nResolution 308, the formal legislation proposing the rescission of immediate priority water and sewer approval for Lakeside, was introduced by Lesher in August 2021.\nMDE's public hearing on the draft discharge permit in October 2021 drew more than 100 upset residents to Easton to speak on the development's environmental, pollution and water quality issues.\nThe issue was made more complex when the Talbot County Planning Commission rescinded its approval of the amendment to Resolution 281 in November 2021.\nWhile the legislation to rescind Resolution 281 remained on the table, attempts were made to come to a compromise by proposing ways to lighten the burden of connecting homes to Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant, ensure that the treated wastewater would meet enhanced nutrient removal standards and give the developer more flexibility in ways to treat the effluent.\nBut ultimately, Lesher pulled his support from Resolution 308 to void the previous legislation, and efforts to compromise failed to garner enough support from the council.\nFrustrated by perceived inaction, county residents, led by Watson, the original petitioner behind legislation rescinding Resolution 281, filed a lawsuit against the Maryland Department of the Environment in May 2022.\nThe lawsuit asked the court to compel the agency to stand behind the Planning Commission's decision of inconsistency and revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewerage system inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Talbot County Circuit Court, was dismissed last June.\nIn late October 2022, MDE made a final determination to issue a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day — a sharp decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nThe limited flow will allow for only 400 residential units to be built, only a small portion of Lakeside's planned development. Any future expansion of the facility will require a major permit modification.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation's 2021 challenge to the permit was revived after the newly revised permit was issued, but in August 2023, a Talbot County judge upheld the permit's issuance. An appeal of that decision is pending in a higher court.\nIn spite of the permit's final approval, members of the Talbot Integrity Project repeatedly requested the council introduce legislation \"resetting\" the development by recognizing the county planning commission's authority to determine consistency of amendments to the comprehensive plan.\nLesher, who had been asked to introduce the legislation, declined to do so in January 2023.\nThe legislation would not have had majority support from the council, he said, and because the Planning Commission's reversal of its consistency finding on Resolution 281 came after the measure was approved by the council, there would be no effect on what had already occurred.\nHowever, Lesher emphasized the limitations of the final permit dealing a significant setback to Lakeside — a significant win for those concerned about the project's scale and environmental impacts.\nOVERSIGHT EFFORTSWith efforts to \"reset\" Lakeside shut down, attention turned to working on ensuring county oversight to what was already approved.\nLast February, Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke introduced legislation, known as Resolution 338, amending the county's comprehensive plan to be consistent with the provisions of Lakeside's wastewater discharge permit.\nUnder the amendment, any expansion of the new wastewater treatment plant would also require a new change to the county's comprehensive plan.\nAttorneys for Trappe and the developer opposed the requirement for the developer to come back before the county for future expansion.\nLesher and Mielke introduced an amendment to Resolution 338 in November, which adds language requiring a certification from the Talbot County Planning Commission of an expansion amendment's consistency with the comprehensive plan.\nAmended Resolution 338 was found consistent with the county's comprehensive plan in December, with commission Chairman Chip Councell saying it would be the county's only chance for review of potential expansion.\nBut even though construction is underway, thanks to Resolution 281 and the issuance of the revised discharge permit, the Maryland Department of the Environment is still seeking clarification on some specifics of the development.\nIn a series of letters sent last year, the agency reemphasized the need for the county to provide the number of equivalent dwelling units in each phase of Lakeside to assess the adequacy of the water and sewer system to accommodate and serve the development.\nTwo of the exhibits to Resolution 281 — maps displaying updates to Trappe's proposed water and sewer service areas — were in need of correction, MDE said. The maps showed additional properties not part of the Lakeside development to have incorrect water and sewer classifications.\nThe mapping issues were requested to be addressed in the form of a comprehensive plan amendment.\nThe county debated over the best way to address MDE's requests last summer, eventually settling on tackling them via comprehensive plan amendments, known as Resolution 347 and Resolution 348.\nThe original version of Resolution 347 provides the number of equivalent dwelling units — 2,874 in total across all six phases, with just over 1,200 designated for immediate water and sewer service.\nIt specified that the phases only represent land uses, not timing or sequence of development, and any changes in phasing or allocation will need to be included in amendments reclassifying any phase's water and sewer service.\nThe resolution's first amendment, introduced last November, struck the language on the phases only representing land use, clarifying that all phases not designated as immediate priority for water and sewer service will need to be reclassified before receiving service from Trappe.\nA second amendment, introduced Jan. 23, adds the provisions of Resolution 338 into the legislation.\nLesher described the inclusion of that language as an alternative to help the Planning Commission find Resolution 347 consistent with the comprehensive plan. Without that finding of consistency, the resolution can't be approved by the council, further delaying fulfillment of MDE's requests.\nResolution 348, introduced last September, was described by County Attorney Patrick Thomas as simple clarification and confirmation of the water and sewer classifications of certain parcels unrelated to Lakeside, which were incorrectly shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281.\nA resolution introduced Jan. 16 by all five council members shed light on more than just the unrelated parcels — it clarified the changes in water and sewer service status for some of Lakeside's parcels that weren't clearly specified in Resolution 281.\nMore specifically, the amendment clarified that prior to the council adopting Resolution 281, the comprehensive plan depicted a portion of Lakeside's property as immediate priority for water service, with the remainder designated as unprogrammed.\nHowever, Resolution 281 actually stated that some parcels within that portion were being redesignated from their \"current\" classification of W-2 to W-1, or immediate priority for water service.\nAnd prior to Resolution 281's approval, maps of sewer service areas in Trappe showed Lakeside's parcels as unprogrammed, the amendment said.\nBut Resolution 281 remapped a portion of Lakeside's parcels from their \"current\" classification of S-2 to immediate priority status for sewer service.\nIntended to resolve confusion and uncertainty from the state environmental agency surrounding the classifications, the amendment confirms Resolution 281 amended certain parcels on the town's water and sewer service maps from unprogrammed status to W-2 and S-2 status.\nWith review of Resolution 347 and Resolution 348 by the Planning Commission and the Public Works Advisory Board imminently approaching, the County Council could soon be facing a tough task.\nIf the resolutions, with or without amendments, are found consistent with the comprehensive plan, the council could soon grant approval, finally completing MDE's requests.\nBut if more questions remain, or if the legislation is found inconsistent, the county will return to the drawing board for further consideration and changes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Significant increases include salary costs and fixed charges.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that $2 million is built out for 33 \"highly necessary,\" additional positions. The budget also accounts for $1.3 million in expected health insurance cost increases due to inflation and the new positions, she said.\nJones noted that while the unrestricted budget is $8.9 million higher than last year, the overall budget of $95.9 million — made up of restricted and unrestricted funds — is only up by $3.6 million. This is mostly due to a year-to-year decrease in federal grant funding.\n\"So it is not, in total, a significant increase,\" Jones said. \"There has been a significant shift from federal to … local.\"\nNext month, the district will present the budget to the Talbot County Council. The council will hold a public budget hearing in May.\nThe district will be asking the county for approximately $18.4 million in capital funding — $18.1 million for ongoing renovations at Chapel District Elementary School and $260,000 for new stadium lights at St. Michaels Middle High School.\nWednesday, Board of Education President Emily Jackson complimented Jones for her work during the budget process. She said she's comfortable with the budget while acknowledging that much is unknown in regards to the state's contributions.\n\"I will vote yes on the budget when it comes to that, because I feel like this is a very sound budget based in fact of what we do know,\" Jackson said.\nBoard Member Cynthia Jurrius said she appreciates that the budget aligns with the district's strategic goals.\n\"We do know we have some potential things down the road that may change the budget as far as what state funding we get (and) what changes may come down the road there,\" Jurrius said. \"But for what we know now, I think this is a good budget and a sound plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tasty Toucan seized the title of Paleta Champion, solidifying their place as an example of excellence in the frozen dessert industry.For those unfamiliar with the term, a Paleta is a Mexican-origin frozen treat, similar to a popsicle, that has gained popularity in the United States. Unlike traditional popsicles, paletas are crafted from fresh fruits, chocolate, or cream. The distinguishing factor lies in their use of natural ingredients and creative flavor combinations, offering a more authentic and artisanal experience.The six artisan Paleta competitors had two hours to make their best strawberry and chocolate popsicle/Paleta. Nikki Neboshynsky, owner and chief tasty officer of Tasty Toucan, Stevensville whirred and stirred her best recipes before the judges. Her final submissions were Summer Tango and 'Tis the Season.The judges analyzed every pop/paleta for taste, uniqueness, presentation and appeal to the market.The Summer Tango is a delightful blend of whole strawberries, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, twisted with layers of mango, dipped in Tajin. On the other hand, the 'Tis the Season features chocolate fudge infused with natural peppermint extract and adorned with shimmering candy cane pieces.Neboshynky's entries are a true standout, earning unanimous praise from the judges for its unique flavor profile, exceptional texture, and eye-catching presentation.\"We are thrilled to recognize Tasty Toucan and Nikki Neboshynsky as the Paleta Champion of 2023,\" stated Evan Waldt, Board member of NAICA. \"Their Paleta not only demonstrated exceptional craftsmanship but also highlighted the innovative spirit that drives our industry. It's an honor to celebrate their talents and dedication to the craft.\"Neboshynsky shared her excitement about the win, saying, \"Tasty Toucan's goal has always been to deliver sweet frozen treats with incredible flavor from natural ingredients, this competition was the perfect platform to showcase that.We are incredibly proud to have received this recognition and are excited to continue our journey of creating unique and delicious popsicles.\"To savor these award-winning paletas, head to Tasty Toucan at 400 Love Point Road in Stevensville.Additionally, you can find them at various concerts, festivals, and catering events.

It outlines why he is \"challenging the unlawful rejection of his nomination\" and his claims that the association exceeded its authority and violated its bylaws.\nEaston Club East, a single-family home neighborhood located off of Dutchmans Lane, is home to more than 800 residents, according to its website. Its Board of Directors, made up of three to seven members, sought nomination forms for three expiring positions on Sept. 16, according to the complaint.\nElection voting takes place from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6. Wade is requesting the Circuit Court issue an injunction to prevent Easton Club East from holding its election until the court issues a judgment.\nIn Wade's filing, which also requests a declaratory judgment and temporary restraining order, he stated that residents wanting to be board candidates were \"asked\" to answer a list of questions in 100 words or less for each question.\nAfter submitting the candidate nomination form on Sept. 30 — the deadline day — to Easton Club East Community Manager Rhonda Bennett, Wade says he was asked shorten his answers to be within the 100-word limit and given until the next morning to do so.\nThe complaint states that Wade sent a revised form on Oct. 1. Later that day, the association's nominating committee informed Wade his nomination submission was rejected \"due to noncompliance\" with Easton Club East guidelines.\nFour other candidates submitted nomination forms that were accepted, three of which included responses more than 100 words, the complaint states.\n\"The unequal treatment of the Plaintiff led to the denial of his nomination and preclusion from participating in what should be a democratic process,\" the complaint reads.\nThe association's bylaws prescribe a nominating committee to collect written candidacy submissions \"within the timeframe and in the format established by the Board of Directors.\"\nBennett declined to provide comment when reached by the Star Democrat Wednesday.\nA hearing for the injunction originally scheduled for Wednesday was postponed. As of Wednesday, no replacement date had been set. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Dorchester County voters face slew of amendments\n\n September 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 737\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This Nov. 5, voters in Dorchester County will have a number of things to vote on in addition to the candidates who are running for election.Some will be voting early and by mail. There is a proposed state constitutional amendment regarding reproductive rights and six proposed Dorchester County Charter Amendments that were placed on the ballot by the County Council from proposals that were made by the Charter Commission appointed by the County Council pursuant to the County Charter.\nPrior to the county elections in 2022, the Dorchester Citizens For Better Government sought to collect enough signatures on referendum petitions to have votes on some of the issues that will be voted on this year. While we were successful in gathering over 1,300 signatures, that was not enough to meet the legal requirements to have our questions placed on the ballot in 2022.\nThis effort, however, prompted the Charter Commission to be appointed by the current County Council. The prior County Council had appointed a Charter Commission that made recommendations for changes to the County Charter, but those recommendations were turned down by the prior County Council. The current Charter Commission has done the hard work that resulted in the proposed amendments that the voters will address.\nSome of the proposals are simple administrative changes to help the County Council and staff be more efficient in running the county government. Question A, if approved, changes when the existing review of the administrative structure of county is to be done. Currently, there was no direction on timing, and the Dorchester Citizens for Better Government found that it was not being done as required.\nThe proposed Charter Amendment requires that it be done \"within the first fiscal year of each County Council term\" so that the council can act at the beginning of their term to make what they determine are necessary changes.\nQuestion B is another administrative matter. It changes the date by which the council shall prepare the annual budget from the current May 1 to May 15 and the date by which the council will adopt the budget from May 31 to June 15. This simply allows the council and staff to have more time in which to do their work in preparing and passing the annual county budget. This is a complicated process that has to consider many points of view, so having more time to accomplish this is certainly reasonable.\nQuestion C proposes amending the charter to remove the requirement that the county manager be a resident of Dorchester County. This is something that the Dorchester Citizens for Better Government considered and felt was a good idea but decided not to address given the number of important but potentially less controversial issues we felt needed to be addressed.\nFinding the right person to be the county manager is or can be a challenging task. There are certainly capable and talented people living in the county that can do the job, and the current county manager, Jerry Jones, is clearly one of them. However, restricting County Council to only hiring someone who must live in the county limits their ability to look for and find someone who could be the best person for the needs of the county.\nCertainly, the County Council can consider that issue as part of their hiring process, but mandating it is not in the best interests of the county, its citizens or its employees. As an example, someone could apply who has the best credentials who lives in a nearby county and owns a home or family farm there. If he or she were the best candidate, the current charter would probably cause them to decline to apply for or be the County Manager, as moving would cost them money.\nOther reasons might be a spouse that has a job in that other county or children who are in their senior year of high school and moving would impact them. Leaving the final decision as to the issue of residence is best left in the hands of the council members that we have elected to make the best decisions for all of us.\nI will stop here and address the remaining three proposed Charter Amendments next time. Before closing, I want to commend and thank the members of the Charter Commission that put so much time and effort into these proposals. They are William Layton, Allen Nelson, Glen Bramble, Linda Henry, George \"Phillip\" Reed, Susan Dukes and Robert Murphy. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If they are not grenade-throwers, Trump labels them RINOs, Republic In Name Only, one of his many favorite go-to insults, as if he is the sole arbiter of who gets to call themselves Republicans.Democrats blame Republicans, with the bright lights showing the reasons for that. Republicans control Congress but cannot control themselves, which means Congress is missing all the levers of power right now.They are not playing well with each other in the sandbox we call Congress.Time to get their heads out of the sandbox.Think outside the sandbox.What would you do if you were Hakeem Jefferies, the minority leader in Congress?So far, from the original battle to select a new speaker nearly a year ago-15 ballots finally installed a weak Kevin McCarthy, forced to make fake promises to the farthest of the far right - to the current rudderless ship of state, the Democrats have played it one way, entirely partisan, understandably.But our understanding has limits.In my field, conflict transformation, we might suggest getting far more inclusive, creative, and collaborative.The Democrats should be brainstorming toward solutions, not toward more adversarial dead-ends. They could easily expand on my little list: Caucus with moderate Democrats, especially those from safe districts, to see who is willing to take slight risks.Find and engage in private discussions with moderate Republicans to see about possible collaboration. Ironically, the Democrats who will virtually certainly win reelection are the best partners with Republicans who also will.Keep close count of the numbers as private talks produce willing members who want to restart Congress and actually get back to work.Find a moderate Republican who will agree to stand for speaker if guaranteed at least 217 votes.Go public, go big, get public opinion quickly on the side of those prepared to take power from the flamethrower extremists.Win the floor vote, get back to doing the business of the American people, not the firebrand business of the anti-democracy zealots.If we believe this type of thinking outside the sandbox is impossible, we quite literally are giving up and giving in to the worst ones, the ones who seek power over instead of power with.I do not claim my version of thinking outside the sandbox is the best, but I will vigorously claim that it's better than the status quo, the Great Sandbox Full Stop we see now.Tom H.

Cambridge City Council meeting.During the open comment period, a resident called commissioners' discussions \"spirited.\" At points during the meeting, commissioners spoke over each other and exchanged sharp words.\nTensions arose after Commission President Sputty Cephas made a motion to hear two rezoning ordinances together, meaning the vote for one ordinance would be postponed to another meeting. The applicant behind the delayed ordinance walked out of the meeting as a result, threatening to withdraw their application.\nJim Cheney with Quality Housing of Cambridge received approval from the Planning Commission to rezone three parcels into mixed-use Downtown Waterfront Development District zoning, opening those parcels up for potential commercial development.\nCurrently, two of the parcels are zoned as general commercial while the third is residential.\nCheney was represented by his attorney, Jesse Hammock, who came to speak during Ordinance 1255's public hearing Oct. 6 and did not seem pleased when the vote was taken off the agenda.\nCheney's neighbor, Benito Lake, is the applicant behind the other rezoning ordinance. Lake put in an application to rezone two of his parcels for the same use as Cheney.\nLake is a month behind Cheney in the rezoning process.\nWhen the council decided to defer the second reading of Ordinance No. 1255 to be heard alongside Ordinance No. 1258, Cheney's attorney withdrew his client's application and walked out of the meeting.\nCity Attorney Patrick Thomas said with the applicant withdrawing, there may be no party to present the case, raising legal issues with approving the rezoning.\nCity staff and commissioners discussed whether they or the Planning Commission could initiate rezoning, and Thomas said they would need to research it but cautioned against rezoning a property without the owner's consent.\nCommissioners and staff expressed intent to make contact with parties soon to align and potentially proceed collectively, acknowledging that delays could further complicate the multi-parcel rezoning.\nCommissioners still held a public hearing on Ordinance No. 1255, though they did not hold a vote. Resident Sharon Smith expressed concerns over access to one of the parcels. City Planner Brian Herrmann responded, saying there is a paper street, a roadway that exists on city maps but has not been constructed.\nShoreline project debate\nTensions flared again when discussing renewing the consulting contract for Cambridge's shoreline project, which aims to thoroughly assess the factors and conditions that contribute to current and potential future flooding issues.\nWhen speaking about the current consultant's contract, which has expired, some commissioners said they lacked a clear understanding of the project's deliverables and progress, hindering their ability to support the contract renewal.\nBut City Manager Glenn Steckman said delaying the shoreline project exposes the city to ongoing flood damage and potential catastrophe if there is a major storm.\nMayor Lajan Cephas, who is not able to vote on the matter, expressed agitation at the ongoing discussion and suggested Larry White, the current consultant for the project, come speak to the commissioners directly.\nSputty Cephas made a motion to defer the item so commissioners can have further conversations. He began speaking about why he made the motion, and Lajan Cephas cut him off, saying, \"Well, I've attended the meetings.\"\nSputty Cephas asked, \"May I finish?\" Lajan Cephas responded, \"No, I'm going to finish.\"\nA few commissioners chuckled.\n\"I'm just to the point where I'm over talking about this, and Mr. White needs to come here and get the full opportunity to give a presentation, not shortened, not edited, so every single question can be asked, and then you can make that determination as commissioners whether you are going to save our shoreline or not, and let that be on the record,\" Lajan Cephas said, closing the discussion.\nThe specific terms of the flood mitigation consultants contract remain unresolved and will be the subject of a future meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It would raise the accommodation tax, or hotel tax, from 4% to 6% in the county.\n\"Anybody who's renting a room to someone for less than four months who's considered a 'transient' would be required to collect accommodations tax,\" Vanhooser said.\nVanhooser pointed out that Talbot County's rate is the lowest in the state. Around $2 million was collected throughout the county in accommodation taxes in fiscal year 2024. If the rate had been 6%, that total would have increased to just above the $3 million mark.\nShe noted the success of the county in the tourism industry. Despite the rate remaining stagnant since 2004, Talbot County has more than doubled its accommodation tax revenue.\n\"We consider this as an indicator of our success as a tourism destination,\" Vanhooser said. \"We know people are coming here. We know we're commanding a premium price, and people are willing to pay that.\"\nIn order to raise the rate, the county needs to ask state delegates this October to bring the proposed change to the General Assembly next year. The county is looking for support from three towns, including Easton, in order to move forward.\nThe towns of Easton, St. Michaels and Oxford collect revenues from the 4% tax on all hotels and short-term rentals within respective town limits or within a mile of those limits. The county collects the tax from lodgings that don't fall in or within a mile of town limits.\n\"The county would like to hear a vote from you on whether you would support this or not, because obviously, we don't want to go to the state legislature and ask for something that you do not support,\" Vanhooser said.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked if the county reached out to hotels in the area for feedback on the spike. Vanhooser said the county's tourism board has hotel representation, adding that the county is aiming to reach out to all hotels as a courtesy.\nAfter a short discussion, the council voiced support for the proposed increase, unanimously voting in favor. No formal resolution was required for the agenda item.\n\"Talbot County obviously is not unique,\" Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery said. \"But we have attractions that are not matched by our neighbors, and for that reason, I fully support raising this to 6%.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Underwater grass populations see slight decline in Bay\n\n August 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES | Section: Headlines \n \n 496\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Underwater grass abundance in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay — a key indicator of water quality — fell from 38,188 acres in 2023 to 36,794 acres in 2024, according to data reviewed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. This acreage remains short of the state's 2025 restoration goal of 79,800 acres.The annual survey of submerged aquatic vegetation was conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science between May and October 2024.\nIn Maryland, despite an overall loss of underwater grass acreage, freshwater populations did well in 2024, and all or part of five rivers surpassed their restoration goals.\n\"The resilience we're seeing in freshwater SAV beds this year is encouraging and reflects years of targeted restoration, outreach, and monitoring,\" DNR's SAV Program Chief Brooke Landry said. \"But sharp declines in widgeon grass across the mid-Bay are concerning, especially given how quickly this species can respond to changes in water quality. These shifts underscore the need for sustained action to improve local conditions and maintain the habitats that so many Bay species rely on.\"\nSubmerged aquatic vegetation plays a critical role in the health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Commonly known as bay grasses, these underwater plants provide essential habitat and nursery grounds for fish, blue crabs and other aquatic life, while also improving water quality by absorbing excess nutrients, stabilizing sediments and slowing shoreline erosion. SAV also helps buffer the Bay against the impacts of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing acidity in the water.\nIn the 2024 survey, rivers surpassing their restoration goals include the North East River at 165%, the Bush River at 133%, the Back River at 275%, the upper Chester River at 274%, and Mattawoman Creek on the Potomac at 110%.\nTwo additional segments reached 75 percent or more of their restoration goals. The northern Chesapeake Bay segment 2, which encompasses the Susquehanna Flats, reached 90% of its 12,149-acre SAV goal and the northern Chesapeake Bay segment 1, which is the area just south of the Susquehanna Flats, reached 88% of its 754-acre SAV goal.\nThe expanse of freshwater SAV populations was overshadowed by the loss of grasses in the mid-Bay, which supports underwater vegetation acclimated to slightly saltier conditions, like widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) and sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata). Substantial losses were observed in Eastern Bay (-36%), at the mouth of the Choptank River (-41%), in the Little Choptank River (-83%), in Fishing Bay (-83%), and in Tangier Sound (-8%).\nWidgeon grass is the most widespread SAV species in the Bay due to its broad salinity tolerance. However, widgeon grass is sensitive to abrupt changes in salinity and water quality, which made it susceptible to loss after storms that delivered fresh, turbid water during the spring and early summer of 2024.\nAdditionally, reports from the department's SAV Program suggest that widgeon grass populations throughout Maryland's tributaries appear to have produced fewer seeds in 2023 than normal. Department scientists are looking into the possibility that widgeon grass seed production is impacted by abnormally high water temperatures. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On several levels, from economic to public safety to morally and ethically, the Trump Administration's aggressive deportation campaign does not serve us well.Over 8 million unauthorized US workers contributed $73 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022 through the use of ITIN numbers, a voluntary process since they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. Additionally, these workers paid $33.9 billion in payroll deductions to Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, programs for which they are not eligible to receive benefits. Tracking down unauthorized taxpaying residents for deportation discourages the voluntary payment of taxes and drives otherwise lawful persons underground.\nResidents fearful of deportation are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement if they become witnesses to or victims of crime. This allows criminals in our community to flourish as a segment of the population becomes vulnerable to extortion, abuse and human trafficking.\nFrom a moral and ethical standpoint, the U.S. has allowed over 10 million unauthorized immigrants to remain in this country for decades – working, raising families and otherwise contributing to the strength of our communities. For most of these residents there is no path to legal residency and citizenship.\nImmigration enforcement has shifted wildly from administration to administration because we lack consistent, rational and comprehensive immigration reform. Recent attempts at bipartisan immigration policy have been scuttled by extremists who see political benefit in the current dysfunctional system. To suddenly snatch long-standing residents off the street as they go about their daily lives, as has happened in this community and many others, is cruel and places us as U.S. citizens in moral jeopardy.\nEach of us has an obligation to speak out to our elected leaders and let them know how we feel about this policy.\nMARY M.

    "content": "Something funny’s going on at the Garfield Center\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — What do you do when, to inherit a large sum of money, you must take a dead guy on his last planned vacation to Monte Carlo? We're all going to find out starting on Feb. 9 with the Garfield Center for the Arts' 2024 Season opener, the over-the-top musical comedy Lucky Stiff.Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty met and wrote their first song together at the Lehman Engel BMI Musical Theatre Workshop in 1983. According to Ahrens, one song led to another, songs grew into musicals, and musicals grew into a body of work. The two later went on to collaborate on the well-known musicals Ragtime, Seussical and Once on This Island.\nTheir first successful collaboration, the musical Lucky Stiff, had its premiere at New York's Playwrights Horizons in an extremely limited run in 1988, but had a longer and more successful run at Maryland's Olney Theatre starting in May 1989. It won the 1990 Helen Hayes Award for Best Musical, and landed its lead actor, Evan Papas, an award for Best Actor in a Musical. In 1994, a studio cast recording was released and the musical had its British debut at the Theatre Royal in England, followed in 1997 by a West End production in London. Since then there has been a film adaptation of the musical, and the production has been successfully staged all around the world.\nBased on the novel \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\" by Michael Butterworth, the musical tells the story of how London shoe salesman Harry Witherspoon is set to inherit $6,000,000 because his distant uncle, Anthony Hendon, has been murdered. Harry is Anthony's only living relative, but he only gets the money if he takes the embalmed, wheelchair-strapped body on his Uncle's planned vacation to Monte Carlo. Harry must follow his Uncle's detailed itinerary for the trip, or the money will go instead to the Universal Dog Home of Brooklyn, whose director, Annabel Glick, follows Harry, hoping he'll make a mistake. Add in an abrasive gangster's girlfriend, a nervous optometrist, a boisterous Italian playboy, a sexy French cabaret singer, and a variety of other over the top characters, and it all results in a story of mistaken identities, disguises, surprising love interests, plot twists and unexpected reveals.\nIn the upcoming Garfield Center production, playing the role of Harry is Max Hagan, who appeared at the GCA in Shrek, Prescription: Murder and Sweeney Todd. Playing Annabel is Shannon Carter, who also appeared in Shrek, Sweeney Todd and The Play That Goes Wrong, among others. Melissa McGlynn, who plays Rita, has appeared in countless Garfield productions, including Annie, Shrek, The Play That Goes Wrong and many more. As Vinnie, JW Ruth again appears at the GCA after memorable performances in The Addams Family, Psycho Beach Party and The Play That Goes Wrong. Natalie Hagan returns to the Garfield stage to play Cabaret performer Dominique after her terrific performances in The Addams Family, Prescription: Murder, and Shrek. Matthew Newman, who sings in the Chester River Chorale, makes his GCA stage debut in the role of Luigi. And in the pivotal role of The Body, the GCA is thrilled to announce that longtime favorite Jim Landskroener is back on stage entertaining our community.\nThe show also boasts a seasoned group of performers in the Ensemble, with each actor-singer playing multiple roles. Appearing in the Ensemble is Heather Joyce-Byers, Nic Carter, Heather Robuck and Steffi Ricketts. Heather Joyce-Byers was last seen as the Narrator in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the GCA. Nic Carter, the Garfield's Theatre Manager, has appeared on our stage many times, including roles in Sweeney Todd, The Play That Goes Wrong, and he directed last season's Prescription: Murder. Heather Robuck and Steffi Ricketts both return to the GCA stage after appearing as Ancestors in The Addams Family.\nDirecting the production is GCA's Executive Director Steven Arnold, the Music Director is JW Ruth, Choreographers are Jennifer Tosten and Natalie Hagan, the Costume Designer is Barbi Bedell, and the Props Designer is Wendy Wiseman. Jordan Dixon is the Stage Manager, Benji Price is the Sound Engineer, Butch Clark is the Technical Director and Builder, Nic Carter is the Lighting Designer, and Beverly Hall Smith is the scenic painter.\nLucky Stiff opens Feb. 9 and will run weekends through Feb. 25. Show times are 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 2 p.m. on Sundays. Tickets may be secured anytime online at www.garfieldcenter.org or purchased in person or over the phone during regular box office hours on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The box office number is 410-810-2060. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local Lightning Rods: Social media, national partisan divisions, culture wars have changed tone and tenor of local politics\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: News \n \n 1445\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Megan Cook, Russ Nelson and Ann Groves Lloyd are mayors of small towns in Maryland, Montana and Wisconsin.Nelson has been the mayor of Belgrade, Montana, for 20 years.\nKaren Rose has been with Sarasota County Schools in Florida for more than three decades serving as a special education teacher, middle school principal and since 2020 on the local school board.\nOver their tenures, the quartet and local officials across the country have seen the exponential growth of social media and its impacts on civil discourse, as well as the increasing intersections between divisive national politics and what's happening at the community level.\nRose, who became chair of the Sarasota County School Board in November, said she's worked for and with multiple superintendents — and times have definitely changed.\n\"We took great pride in no one knowing our political affiliation. We kept each other in check. It was a matter of pride,\" Rose said.\nNow, Florida conservatives (including Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis) and progressives (including some outspoken teacher unions and Democratic-leaning school boards) clash locally over COVID and vaccine rules, controversial books in libraries, the state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law restricting elementary school teachers from talking to young students about gender identity and sexual orientation and how to teach America's racial history.\nRose said she saw some previous superintendents let politics take away from the focus on academic achievement.\n\"Cultural wars were being let in and taking hold,\" she said.\nRose, a Republican, said the current superintendent, Terry Connor, (who was hired last year) has shown a focus on academic achievement and data-driven solutions.\nBut that's not stopping the politics at board meetings, she said.\n\"There is clearly an organized agenda that is political in the boardroom during public comment,\" Rose said. \"It's very organized.\"\nRose said Democratic advocates will speak during the comment period, noting a recent hearing where 67 people spoke, with only three focused on academics.\nSome of the recent comments have been geared toward Bridget Ziegler, who has served on the Sarasota school board since 2014 and was a co-founder of the lightning rod conservative education group Moms for Liberty, which has become a GOP political force.\nLiberal activists and other critics have called for Ziegler to resign her post amid a police investigation of her husband, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Christian Ziegler, over an alleged sexual encounter with his wife and another woman. Christian Ziegler could face video voyeurism charges for allegedly videotaping the encounter. Bridget Ziegler has never faced any legal allegations in the episode. She did not respond to an interview request.\nRose said political advocates, as well as some media outlets, have focused on Florida controversies, including debates over controversial and mature content at libraries. Those debates, along with fights over drag shows at libraries, other public venues and local businesses, have been happening across the country.\n\"They continue to talk about book banning. This board has not banned one single book,\" she said.\nConservative and progressive advocates increasingly view local councils and school boards as venues to mobilize supporters and address issues of concern.\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, senior policy adviser for Equality Florida (an LGBTQ rights group), said the group has \"a long history\" of mobilizing parents and community members to attend school board and council meetings when issues of concern arise.\n\"We have also had a regular presence at the Sarasota school board meetings, especially in the wake of recent Moms For Liberty/Ziegler scandals,\" he said.\nAnti-war and pro-Palestinian activists have pushed liberal jurisdictions, including San Francisco, to approve resolutions condemning Israel's war in Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and calling for a ceasefire. Other progressives advocated for spending cuts and shifting money away from police after the death of George Floyd in 2020.\nAmong conservatives, Mark Lee Dixson, a Christian pastor and anti-abortion rights advocate from Texas, has gotten 65 cities and seven counties in Texas, Nebraska, New Mexico and other states to pass Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn Initiatives. The measures aim to signal communities' oppositionto abortion rights and resistance to having abortion clinics in their jurisdictions.\n'THAT'S MY TECHNOLOGY'\nFrustrations with and more cautious approaches related to social media are common refrains from local officials wary of viral controversies and local rumor mills.\nIn small-town Montana, where Belgrade has a population approaching 13,000 people, Nelson avoids social media and its penchant for unpleasant and contentious discourse.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson, who has been in office since 2003 and won reelection in November for a final term before his expected retirement. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nThe more contentious nature of local politics — whether it comes from social media criticism or its mirroring of national fights over hot-button issues or former President Donald Trump — also can discourage potential candidates for local office and can lead to shorter tenures for some city, county and school district staff, Nelson said.\n\"Good people see how challenging it is and don't enter the game,\" he said.\nAnn Groves Lloyd is the mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin, a town of just over 3,200 residents near Madison. Groves Lloyd describes herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small-town mayor\" on her social media profile on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe progressive mayor is a vehement critic of former President Trump, is no fan of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and is not sure she can find compromise or common ground with conservative adherents of alt-right media such as Alex Jones or those getting worked up about drag shows.\nGroves Lloyd also said she saw already rough civil discourse get even rougher during the debates over COVID mask mandates, vaccines and shutdowns.\n\"It was pretty toxic,\" she said. \"For me, personally, I took a giant step back from social media. I used to post a lot of mostly progressive things on Facebook.\"\nNow, the Wisconsin mayor keeps her ideological posts to X, which has a national and international focus.\nShe also worries about social media rumor mills and rabbit holes leading constituents astray.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" she said.\nSome activists counter that local governments and school boards are not always forthcoming with information or friendly with constituents who are less connected or come from opposing political camps.\nStill, social media and live and replayed online broadcasts of meetings allow more residents and local businesses to engage with and keep tabs on local matters.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton, on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\"The town is using social media as another way of sharing information with the community. It's a quick, easy and efficient way to share information,\" she said.\nEven Nelson said social media helps drive interest and council meeting attendance on hot-button issues such as \"dogs, fireworks and marijuana,\"referring to city regulations and decisions on dispensaries after Montana voters legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2020.\nPUTTING THE PARTISAN IN NONPARTISAN\nWhile many local elected offices are nonpartisan, partisan politics has increasingly become part of local elections and governance.\nIn Montana, Nelson, a self-described moderate Republican, voiced frustration with the \"far right\" conservative agenda from the state legislature impacting and dictating policy paths to local entities.\nConservative state lawmakers have passed laws requiring local school districts to open their enrollments to out-of-district students, and looked to put limits on some municipal zoning powers, including efforts to develop more affordable and multifamily units statewide.\nBack East, Easton, which has a population of close to 17,500, is part of Talbot County, which saw a contentious fight that drew national political and media attention over a Confederate statue in front of the county courthouse.\nThe Talbot Boys statue, erected in 1916, was relocated to a private memorial park in Virginia in 2022 after a vote by the county council. Cook said Easton has been able to avoid some of the wave of national divisiveness, but she has definitely seen a greater interest from Democratic and Republican groups in local races, as well as more questions from voters about her own party affiliation.\n\"In town elections, we don't run on a party system, which I love. It shouldn't matter what you're registered as, if you need assistance from the town we're going to be there,\" said Cook, a Democrat, who was elected mayor last year after serving as Town Council president.\n\"That being said, I was asked more during my last campaign what I was registered as than I have before and both Central Committees seemed to want to be involved.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Participants completed a 2.4-mile swim in the Choptank River, a 112-mile bike ride through Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and a marathon that ended at Long Wharf Park.\nIn the overall men's category, Matthew Tatum came in first place at 8 hours, 38 minutes and 12 seconds. Lopez and Hugues Abram finished in second and third place, respectively. In the overall women's category, Jill Jacinth placed first in 9 hours, 55 minutes and 43 seconds. Carly Zanatta and Dana Glodek placed second and third, respectively.\nFor Lopez — who finished the race in 8 hours, 46 minutes and 23 seconds, landing him first place in the men's age 35 to 29 category — its the hard work that goes into an Ironman that creates a real camaraderie among racers.\n\"I mean you appreciate the hard work that everybody out here is putting in,\" he said. \"So that kind of brings us together.\"\nThis was Lopez's 19th Ironman, but his first in Cambridge. He said he had never placed first in his age group or finished second overall in a full Ironman before this race. The Mission, Texas native will be traveling to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii for the Ironman World Championship.\nLopez called the Cambridge course beautiful, admiring the cooler weather and greenery.\n\"In south Texas we don't have a lot of trees and green,\" he said.\nMatthew Tatum, who was the first place finisher of the race and placed first in the mens 40-44 age category, said with something like 24 full Ironmans under his belt, the Cambridge course is his favorite.\n\"This community is incredible,\" he said.\nAfter finishing the race, Tatum talked about a recent bike accident that resulted in multiple broken bones and a punctured lung. His word of the day was \"phoenix,\" the mythological bird that rises to life from its own ashes.\n\"Persistence and 'anything is possible' really pays off,\" he said.\nEaston residents Ryan Levin and Casey Brasington, who volunteered in the race, watched Tatum cross the finish line. This was the couple's first year volunteering, but they have watched the race from the sidelines before. Both of them enjoy the atmosphere.\n\"Every family member that's out here makes me cry almost,\" Brasington said before Levin recalled a family of about 40 coming out last year to support a racer who was running for family members they had lost the year before.\n\"There's so many emotions,\" Levin said.\nLevin hopes to compete in the Ironman within the next two years. He said he has run a marathon and has biked a century, which is 100 miles.\nJaime Ferns and her mother-in-law-to-be Mary Pat Kiessling were two of the many supporters cheering from the sidelines of the race on Saturday. Ferns' fiancé Joseph Kiessling, Mary Pat's son, participated in the race with his father Brian Kiessling.\nThis is the father-son duo's second full Ironman, Ferns said.\n\"They started doing it 2019 when an Ironman came to their hometown in Michigan, where Joseph is originally from and Brian lives,\" said Ferns, who is from the Washington, D.C., area.\nFerns said she loves seeing all the people and the excitement at the races. She said she's \"in awe\" of the athletes.\n\"Tomorrow's going to be rough, I think,\" she said about recovery for Joseph. \"But it's worth it.\"\nMarci Goldberg, who has finished three Ironmans herself, came out to Cambridge to cheer on friends.\n\"Because no matter how many times you've done it, it's a tough day and you need that encouragement,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, dies at 100\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the diplomat with the thick glasses and gravelly voice who dominated foreign policy as the United States extricated itself from Vietnam and broke down barriers with China, died Wednesday, his consulting firm said.He was 100.With his gruff yet commanding presence and behind-the-scenes manipulation of power, Kissinger exerted uncommon influence on global affairs under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, earning both vilification and the Nobel Peace Prize.Decades later, his name still provoked impassioned debate over foreign policy landmarks long past.Kissinger's power grew during the turmoil of Watergate, when the politically attuned diplomat assumed a role akin to co-president to the weakened Nixon.\"No doubt my vanity was piqued,\" Kissinger later wrote of his expanding influence. \"But the dominant emotion was a premonition of catastrophe.\"A Jewish man who fled Nazi Germany with his family in his teens, Kissinger in his later years cultivated the reputation of respected statesman, giving speeches, offering advice to Republicans and Democrats alike and managing a global consulting business.For eight restless years - first as national security adviser, later as secretary of state, and for a time in the middle holding both titles - Kissinger ranged across the breadth of major foreign policy issues. He conducted the first \"shuttle diplomacy\" in the quest for Middle East peace. He used secret channels to pursue ties between the United States and China, ending decades of isolation and mutual hostility.He initiated the Paris negotiations that ultimately provided a face-saving means - a \"decent interval,\" he called it - to get the United States out of a costly war in Vietnam. Two years later, Saigon fell to the communists.And he pursued a policy of detente with the Soviet Union that led to arms control agreements and raised the possibility that the tensions of the Cold War and its nuclear threat did not have to last forever.At age 99, he was still out on tour for his book on leadership. Asked in July 2022 interview with ABC whether he wished he could take back any of his decisions, Kissinger demurred, saying: \"I've been thinking about these problems all my life. It's my hobby as well as my occupation. And so the recommendations I made were the best of which I was then capable.\"Kissinger was a practitioner of realpolitik - using diplomacy to achieve practical objectives rather than advance lofty ideals. Supporters said his pragmatic bent served U.S. interests; critics saw a Machiavellian approach that ran counter to democratic ideals.He was castigated for authorizing telephone wiretaps of reporters and his own National Security Council staff to plug news leaks in Nixon's White House.He was denounced on college campuses for the bombing and allied invasion of Cambodia in April 1970, intended to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines to communist forces in South Vietnam.That \"incursion,\" as Nixon and Kissinger called it, was blamed by some for contributing to Cambodia's fall into the hands of Khmer Rouge insurgents who later slaughtered some 2 million Cambodians.Pudgy and messy, Kissinger incongruously acquired a reputation as a ladies' man in the staid Nixon administration.Kissinger, who had divorced his first wife in 1964, called women \"a diversion, a hobby.\" Jill St. John was a frequent companion.But it turned out his real love interest was Nancy Maginnes, a researcher for Nelson Rockefeller whom he married in 1974.Yet Kissinger was reviled by many Americans for his conduct of wartime diplomacy.He was still a lightning rod decades later: In 2015, an appearance by the 91-year-old Kissinger before the Senate Armed Services Committee was disrupted by protesters demanding his arrest for war crimes and calling out his actions in Southeast Asia, Chile and beyond.Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in the Bavarian city of Fuerth on May 27, 1923, the son of a schoolteacher.His family left Nazi Germany in 1938 and settled in Manhattan, where Heinz changed his name to Henry.Kissinger had two children, Elizabeth and David, from his first marriage. \n \n Caption: Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Oct. 10, 2017, in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First, the development corporation reached agreement with the Cambridge City Council in a lawsuit that included the Yacht Maintenance Company. Court records show the case was closed on Wednesday.\nThe second item was that the Cambridge City Council Monday night will hear a presentation by a potential hotel developer for building on Cambridge Harbor.\nCambridge residents are finally going to get a glimpse behind the curtain of secrecy that has shrouded much of the Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s plans for years, secrecy that was unnecessary and resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said the presentation will give the community an opportunity to provide comment on the plans before the development corporation makes an agreement. Moving these talks into the public eye was part of the lawsuit settlement between the the city and Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.\nBuilding that hotel is the keystone of the waterfront development. All other developments will revolve around that.\nCWDI Board President Angie Hengst said no deal has been made with the hotel company, but CWDI has been in talks with the developer for the past year or so. She called the developer \"fairly local\" who has developed hotels in Ocean City and other parts of the state. Hengst said CWDI will be working with the city and county to identify the appropriate time to sign a deal after \"various details\" have been worked through.\nIt is about time.\nWe have contended that the Cambridge Harbor project is an exciting proposal. No doubt there are many residents who will support those plans. The problem has been the secrecy that has kept project details and especially how the project will be financed behind closed doors.\nThe lawsuit settlement not only brings some details of the project proposal into public view, it will free up much needed money for the development corporation. Property held by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. can now be sold to Yacht Maintenance Company, a move that will raise money for the cash-starved CWDI.\nThe sale has the added benefit of providing space for one of Cambridge's hallmark companies. Driving down Maryland Avenue, one only needs to see the shrink-wrapped Sequoia — Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidential yacht — to realize the prestigious work Yacht Maintenance Company does.\nRideout said the parties are currently working on developing the memorandum of understanding for some outstanding issues.\nIn May, the City Council filed a lawsuit against CWDI, the group spearheading the Cambridge Harbor project, and Yacht Maintenance, a boat service company. The lawsuit alleged CWDI was in violation of a transfer agreement it entered into with the city in June 2021.\nThe transfer agreement gave CWDI roughly 22 acres of land — including about 2.6 acres of land subject to a lease agreement between the city and Yacht Maintenance — for $5.\nThe city's lawsuit sought $75,000 in damages and requested temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping defendants from transferring any portion of the property in violation of the covenants of the 2021 transfer agreement.\nIn its lawsuit, the council argued that CWDI violated the agreement in March 2022 by transferring city-donated property to CWDI Holdings, a limited liability company also named in the suit. Later that month, CWDI and CWDI Holdings filed a response to the lawsuit, alleging the city and CWDI agreed to CWDI creating CWDI Holdings to hold title to property named in the property transfer agreement.\nWith the settlement, the city and CWDI have entered into an agreement that allows CWDI to transfer property from the 2021 transfer agreement to Yacht Maintenance.\nHengst said CWDI's Board of Directors is feeling great about the settlement.\n\"This just allows us to move forward,\" she said. \"Hopefully we've opened up lines of communication with all of our partners, and hopefully this is a fresh new start as we move forward and just advance the Cambridge Harbor project.\"\nHengst said they are \"eager\" to move forward with the property transfer to Yacht Maintenance, which she hopes will happen in the next few weeks.\nAt the most recent CWDI Board meeting on July 31, the board talked about concerns with finances and the need for CWDI to sell property so that it can use that money to pay for other things. On Friday, Hengst told the Star Democrat that being able to sell property to Yacht Maintenance will help the organization's financial situation.\nThere is more work to be done.\nRideout said the city is still in discussion with CWDI \"on a number of issues.\" He said he thinks they will be able to reach agreements on these issues to \"help the future development go more smoothly.\"\nHengst hopes CWDI will be able to make some significant progress on Cambridge Harbor now that a settlement has been reached in litigation between CWDI and the city. She said CWDI hopes to break ground on its promenade expansion project soon.\nWe hope this represents a new chapter in relationships between Cambridge Waterfront Development and its community partners. Far too much money was wasted on lawyer fees that could have gone to supporting the harbor projects.\nAs we said earlier in this editorial: It is about time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Three candidates compete for District 5 Dorchester Board of Education seat\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 5 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 5 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nCHRIS WEEDLETON\nChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhy are you running?\nI was honored to be appointed last year by the County Council to represent District 5, based on the experiences and skills that I have built working in education and workforce development innovations across the country over the last several decades. I have enjoyed the process of collaborating with the board and community stakeholders to align our resources and find solutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for our students, educators and schools. I feel like I have added value and see the opportunity to help make further improvements. I would like to continue that work for a full term.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThere are many needs and challenges that we face as a community and school district. Among the most important issues currently is the need to have a clear sense for where we are and where we need to go as a school system, and a consistent culture across the system and in each school for accountability and working together to find the best solutions. The current process for finding the best next leader for DCPS is an important part of that, and the board is starting with direct engagement with the community to get the voice of all stakeholders as part of this process. I believe that having a culture that brings all resources that we have as a collective community to help create the best conditions for our students to find success, is among the most important issues we face right now and into the future.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThere are so many positive improvements happening across our community, and the collective impact of community partners is starting show real results, in concert with the leadership of DCPS. It is no accident that the timing of these improvements comes in the second year of a 10 year comprehensive plan as part of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading that was started in Dorchester County by a wide range of community partners. This has included nonprofits, business partners and action agencies including Moving Dorchester Forward, the Health Department, the Chamber of Commerce, the library system, the YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs and United Way. Much of this was started through the leadership of the John & Janice Wyatt Foundation. DCPS is a key leader in this effort through the Early Childhood Advisory Council. The more that we can bring EVERYONE together in this collective effort, the more we will see continued progress. Learn more at: https://www.dorchestercglr.com/\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me. I welcome anyone who wants to learn more to check out my website at: https://skillsgap.org/welcome\nMIKE HARTFORD\nMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nMy main focus is keeping our current schools in place. The last few years have been challenging for the current students, board and parents. We need to be sure parents have a true say in what is happening and a place to have their questions answered. I'm running to bring transparency to the current issues at hand and to keep the parents well informed in not only our district, but our county. Its time the younger generation stands up and starts making the changes they wish to see.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe infrastructure of certain schools. We need to explore all options that work for the parents, not just the budget. We have schools that have been standing in low-lying areas creating common problems that if fixed, could potentially save the small communities around them. These communities make our county great, if we remove the school(s), we not only face logistical nightmares for parents, grandparents and siblings. We need reasonable solutions that the parents of the students who attend the schools can come to an agreement on.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nWhile trending in the right direction, we need to keep the momentum. Providing parents of toddlers and childcare workers educational supplies and online classes to further their skills could potentially be beneficial. The parents/daycare providers could use these supplies/skills to ensure our young children are mentally, physically and emotionally ready for their big transition. The current pk-3 option we are bringing into the 2024-2025 school year is a great idea, but at what expense?\nJEROME HARRIS\nJerome Harris is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Harris did not respond to the candidate questions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I didn't shoot the whole game, but at least I made the one that mattered.\" The first half was back and forth between the two Talbot County rivals, with Easton (0-0) carrying a 13-11 lead into the second quarter, and the Sabres rallying, McCall's baseline drive with 0.2 seconds remaining giving Sts. Peter & Paul (4-2) at 25-24 lead at the break.\n\"They had that 7-0 run right at the beginning (of the game),\" Easton head coach Lesley Staehli said of her team. \"Then it was like a couple of mental errors here and there.\" But the Sabres (4-2) took control of momentum in the third quarter, outscoring the Warriors, 11-5. McCall's follow and Quade's third 3-pointer nudged Sts. Peter & Paul to a 30-24 lead early in the third. Easton answered.\nKate Adelman (11 points) hit a pair of free throws.\nAyari Granados Martinez followed suit, getting Easton (2-3) within 30-28 with 3:37. Serenity Velez (teamhigh 14 points) converted one of two, paring the lead to just one with under 2 minutes left in the third.\nBut the Sabres closed the third with a six-point burst, as Quade (game-high 17 points) canned the last of her four 3-pointers, was fouled, and hit the foul shot. Lucy Rankin then scored off a Sam Murphy assist, giving Sts. Peter & Paul a 36-29 lead with one quarter left.\n\"I think they just basically started out-rebounding us,\" Staehli said of the Sabres. \"First half we were constantly on the boards and then they just started out-rebounding us, getting better position than us to the basket.\nThat kind of gave them some second-chance shots.\" After an Adelman layup, Rankin scored on a follow to keep Sts. Peter & Paul's lead at seven. But with Quade and McCall (15 points) playing with four fouls, the Sabres offense lost traction.\nEaston took advantage. Velez made a free throw with 6:22 left. A little over two minutes later she drained a trey, cutting the deficit to three. Siang Sama connected with a pair of free throws, making it a one-point difference.\nVelez then made the second half of a two freethrow opportunity, creating a 38-38 tie with 42.2 seconds to go.\nNeither team could break the stalemate until Sam Murphy got the ball on the right side of the basket near the 3-point line. Murphy charged in, went straight up, hit the shot and was fouled, edging the Sabres ahead at 40-38.\n\"'It's crunch time,'\" said Sam Murphy, who missed the following free throw. \"'I have to take it to the hoop.' That's what I was thinking. We were just passing it around and I was like, 'OK, I've had enough of this.'\" Quade then fouled out with 8.2 seconds left, sending Adelman to the line. The Easton guard made one of two, but McCall launched an outlet pass to Rankin, whose layup punctuated the victory, sending the Sabres flooding onto the court in celebration.\n\"When the fourth quarter came around we only had six men that could really be out there at that moment in time,\" Coach Murphy said. \"We had foul trouble and we lost our momentum. So third quarter, confident.\nThen fourth quarter was a little nervous. After Sam's drive to the basket, I felt a little more confident that they knew what they needed to seal the deal.\" \n \n Caption: WILLIAM HAUFE/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Saints Peter and Paul's Avery McCall, left, hugs Sam Murphy Monday after Murphy hit the game-winning basket against Easton.\n\n WILLIAM HAUFE/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Saints Peter & Paul's Morgan Quade (4) scored a game-high 17 points in Monday's victory over Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'The best of us': Montana cowboy poet Wally McRae dead at 89\n\n July 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amanda Eggert Montana Free Press | Section: News \n \n 1037\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cowboy poet Wallace \"Wally\" McRae of Colstrip died June 22 at the age of 89. McRae gained fame in Montana — and across the country — for the resonance of his voice and the causes he furthered with it.The youngest of three children, McRae grew up steeped in cowboy culture and was drawn to entertaining from a young age. He found success in both arenas. In 2020, he was inducted into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame. A long list of statewide and national organizations recognized McRae's creative contributions, including the National Endowment for the Arts.\nIn a 2018 interview with Andy Hedges, McRae recounted how at 4-years-old, he recited a little poem at a local Christmas program that was so warmly received it left a lasting impression. \"I mean — it was showtime,\" he said. \"I was a hero. The lights came up. The microphone got live and I was addicted to poetry from that time on.\"\nAfter graduating from Colstrip High School, he enrolled in Montana State University, where he was president of his class and earned a degree in zoology. Shortly thereafter, McRae joined the Navy, which took him to the Mediterranean and his future wife. McRae married Ruth Hayes, a nurse from Pennsylvania, in 1960. They raised one son, Clint, and two daughters, Allison and Natalie, on a cattle ranch near the one McRae's grandfather owned.\nMcRae used his affinity for speaking and writing in a variety of venues. He worked as a rodeo announcer, penned four books of poetry and one of prose, and acted, directed and wrote plays for the Coal and Cattle Country Players theater group in Colstrip.\nFor decades, he used his voice, both literally and figuratively, to advocate for family ranches and the land and water critical to them. He engaged in a protracted battle with the energy developers who sought to transform Colstrip into a sprawling industrial zone to power the country, using his poetry to describe the companies' tactics to garner access to the coal beneath ranchers' land and the landscapes and community ties at stake.\nIn 1984, McRae helped launch the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada. He became a fixture at the event, attending it every year for 35 years. In 1990, he became the first cowboy poet — and the first Montanan — to become a National Heritage Fellow, an honor presented by the Washington, D.C.,-based National Endowment for the Arts.\n\"People didn't realize it, but cowboys were one of the few surviving occupational groups that still dealt in poetry,\" he said in an interview his alma mater published in 2009. \"Sailors and loggers and farmers and military personnel all have left a history of writing poetry, but for some reason they quit. We didn't.\"\nStephanie Davis, a songwriter who first met McRae at one of the early National Cowboy Poetry Gatherings, said he may have cultivated a \"cowboy curmudgeon\" image, \"but underneath that, he was a giant marshmallow.\"\nDavis said McRae donated the National Endowment for the Arts prize money — $10,000 — to support the Montana Cowboy Poet Gathering. McRae's generosity helped Davis, who was living in Nashville at the time, return to her beloved home state of Montana to perform.\n\"I thought that was extraordinary: you win something and donate it right away to somebody else,\" she said, going on to describe him as a man who \"contained multitudes.\"\n\"I don't think he had a TV. I think he had shelves of books. He and his wife, Ruth, just read,\" Davis said. \"He was just the best of us: the best of Montana, the best poet. It's a huge loss.\"\nTeresa Erickson, a Billings resident who led the Northern Plains Resource Council from 1985 to 2019, described McRae as one of the organization's earliest and strongest advocates for family agricultural operations.\nErickson said the willingness of McRae and others to push back on mining companies' hunger for southeastern Montana coal moved the needle on several issues. Northern Plains prevailed in their nearly four-decades-long fight to stop a railroad from being built to transport Powder River Basin coal through southeastern Montana. In a similar vein, Erickson said coalbed methane production, which she described as a \"disastrous\" prospect for southeastern Montana landowners, \"never really took off in Montana\" due in part to the efforts of McRae and others.\n\"He loved Colstrip and loved eastern Montana,\" Erickson said. \"He loved the prairie very, very much and saw the beauty of it. Not everybody's like that.\"\nErickson attributes some of McRae's charisma to his voice. She said he had\n\"the quintessential Marlboro man\" voice, which may have been related, she said, to McRae's fondness for cigarettes. Erickson said McRae's integrity also made a lasting impression on her and others.\nErickson recalled McRae's confrontation with a coal company employee who'd surreptitiously squirreled away some Northern Plains-produced fact sheets ahead of a meeting with the Northern Cheyenne tribe, the Bureau of Land Management and residents impacted by nearby coal-mining operations.\n\"He stood for truly conservative principles in the purest form of what that means — and not the political sense.\"\nJim Jensen, former Montana Environmental Information Center executive director\n\"Wally just marched right up to [the coal company representative] and said, 'Give me back those fact sheets right now.' The guy denied it, and he said, 'We saw you take them.' The guy very sheepishly handed them over to him,\" Erickson recalled. \"There was just something about that act. He wasn't afraid, and he had a moral code, which was: You don't lie to people. You're honest.\"\nJim Jensen, former Montana Environmental Information Center executive director, first met McRae in the late 1970s while learning about coal development in Colstrip as a graduate student at the University of Montana. Jensen said McRae offered an eloquent \"perspective about what was before, what was coming, and what was worth saving.\"\n\"I loved Wally McRae,\" Jensen said. \"He stood for truly conservative principles in the purest form of what that means — and not the political sense.\"\nIn \"My Requiem,\" a poem McRae recited in his 2018 conversation with Hedges, he offered this aspiration:\n\"Some would build an edifice\nAn architectural gem\nTo serve throughout the ages\nAs a lasting requiem\nBut grant to me this final wish\nWhen I say that last amen\nMay my mark be carried lightly\nIn the hearts and minds of men.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Country Cooking: Fresh pork on the farm",
    "date": "2025-01-14",
    "author": "MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking",
    "content": "Country Cooking: Fresh pork on the farm\n\n January 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Life \n \n 1716\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A couple of years ago I did a story and recipes about the annual hog slaughtering adventures on the farm and decided to re-run this as one of my favorite memories to share with my readers.As a matter of fact, just a few weeks ago I was asked if I was going to do one this winter — here it is, my friend.\nThis part of farm life, hog slaughtering, is a dying process as not many of the older farmers are even on farms any more and the younger generation prefers to concentrate on more modern aspects of farming, such as specialty vegetables, fruit trees, pick-your-own and more.\nEach year my parents held an two old-fashioned hog killings to fill the smokehouse and freezers with meat, once in November and once in March.\nThis supply of meat fit perfectly with the previous summer's canned vegetables, jellies, relishes, applesauce and much more, not to mention the shed with potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions and turnips.\nIt was not a lot of hard work because we all pitched in and my dad had several farm hands helping. Everybody left at the end of the day with full stomachs and a package of sausage, scrapple or seasoning meat.\nToday as I ride past the old farm place I get upset looking at and thinking of those days gone by. I can still see the late Mr. Jim Showell ready to hang the meat and the late Mr. Ed Sturgis ready to hang the iron pots over the fire he would make.\nMom would allow her children and grandchildren to \"help\" with the work, but she had a hand in it all — especially the final taste testing of the sausage and scrapple.\nThe morning of the slaughter found my sister and I scrubbing down the cutting services, the mixing utensils, the pans to hold scrapple and the trays for both loose sausage and link sausage. In the smokehouse waited the exceptionally clean, sharp meat hooks to hang the hams and shoulders. Finally, there were the cans to hold the fresh pressed lard.\nThe one job that my mother had every year was sausage maker. Either one of my brothers or nephews would feed the cut-up pork parts into the top of the grinder. My mother sat stretching sheep's intestines for the casing over the tube and working the ground sausage as it fed into the intestines and into a large bowl. This was a job that I later inherited, and since it was the only job that you could actually sit at our hog killings, I didn't mind.\nThere are many funny stories associated with \"hog killing adventures\" throughout the years but time will not allow today. In the next few winter months, I will slip them in.\nThe one I love the most was when the hogs could have gotten me in big trouble but my bus driver, the late Mr. George Hudson, was related to mom, and he was a farmer.\nOne cold hog killing morning, I was leaving to go to school on the bus, and I begged Mr. Sturgis to cut out the hog brains for my class to study in biology. He did, but he put them in a small brown paper bag.\nBy the time we got to Stephen Decatur High School the bag broke through as we got off the bus. My friend Nellie saw it first, screamed, hollered \"dead,\" and everyone ran. I tried to explain to our new principal but to no avail. He just didn't understand a country girl's ambition to succeed in biology.\nLet's cook some delicious fresh pork.\nCOUNTRY PORK RIBS3 pounds country style pork ribs (about 8 ribs), 2 tsps smoked salt, ½ tsp black pepper, 2 tsps smoked paprika, 1 tsp dried thyme, ½ tsp cayenne pepper.\nPreheat your oven to 325 degrees. Arrange the ribs in a single layer in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking dish. Mix together the dry rub ingredients and sprinkle the rub on top of the ribs. Cover the baking dish tightly with heavy duty foil (or a double layer of regular foil), and bake until the ribs are very tender, about 2 hours. With a slotted spatula, remove the cooked ribs to a broiler-safe, foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet. Either flip them or place them on their side, so that the fat is exposed to the heating element. The goal is to brown it. Switch the oven to broil on high ( 500°F) and set an oven rack 6 inches below the heating element (not directly below).Baste the ribs with the pan juices, then broil them until the fat is browned, 3-4 minutes. Baste the ribs one more time with the pan juices and serve.\nPORK ROAST6-pound boneless pork shoulder, 3 cloves garlic (minced), 2 tsps salt, 2 tsps ground pepper, 1 tbsp chopped fresh sage, 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, 2 large red onions (sliced into 1-inch wedges), olive oil, 1/2 cup reserved pan drippings.\nOne day before you plan to serve the roast, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Tie roast well with kitchen twine. Rub roast with mix of herbs and garlic and place in oiled roasting pan, Bake in preheated oven, uncovered, for 3 hours. Remove roast from pan and add onions; toss with pan drippings (if there isn't enough fat in the pan, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and toss onions to coat). Place roast on top of onions and return to oven, uncovered, for an additional 4 hours (check pan every hour to be sure the pan drippings don't evaporate — add 2 cups of water if necessary). Remove the roast from the roasting pan and place it in a glass baking dish and allow it to cool before you wrap the dish well with plastic and put it in the fridge overnight. Reserve the onions and pan drippings separately in the fridge overnight too. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of drippings (maybe 1 1/4 after you remove the fat). Add water to the drippings if you don't have enough.\nAbout an hour before you want to serve this yummy roast, preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Remove the twine from the roast and slice into 1/4-inch slices, \"Shingle\" the slices in a large casserole dish. Pour about 1/2 cup of the reserved pan drippings over the slices, cover with foil, and place in preheated oven for 45 minutes, Season individual servings and serve.\nPORK LOIN CHOPSPork loin chop, 2 tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp salt, ½ tbsp ground black pepper, ½ tbsp garlic powder, ½ tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp dry mustard powder, 1 tsp ground sage, ¼ tsp cayenne pepper, ¼ tsp celery salt.\nMeasure out all of the dry ingredients into a small mixing bowl (or the bowl of a spice grinder). Set aside. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees and lightly grease or spray a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Wash and trim your country style pork loin chops as needed, then pat the pork dry using paper towels. Apply the pork seasoning to all sides of the pork chops generously. For about 2 lbs of country style pork loin chops you'd use 2 tbsps of the pork seasoning. Place the seasoned country style pork loin chops into your prepared baking dish in a single layer. Bake in the middle of your oven's center rack for 35-40 minutes, or until the pork reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees. Remove from the oven and serve immediately for best taste.\nPULLED PORK1 3-pound pork shoulder roast, ½ cup beef broth, ⅓ cup apple cider vinegar, ½ chopped yellow onion, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.\nSpread chopped onions on the bottom of the slow cooker. Add pork shoulder and pour in chicken broth, Worcestershire and cider vinegar right on the pork. Add mustard and brown sugar and use your hands to rub it all in the pork. Cover the slow cooker and set on high for 5 hours. Shred pork with 2 forks and pour in BBQ sauce. Don't pour the whole bottle in, just enough to cover the meat according to taste. Cover and cook on high for 1 more hour. Serve on your favorite sandwich rolls or buns.\nBACON, BEAN AND POTATO SOUP1 pound dry navy beans, 6 oz bacon, 2 cloves garlic, 1 yellow onion, 3 carrots, 3 ribs celery, 2 pounds potatoes, 6 cups chicken broth, 1 8-oz can tomato sauce, salt and pepper to taste.\nThe day before you want to serve, place the beans in a large bowl and add enough cool water to cover the beans by 2-3 inches. Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, cut the bacon into one-inch pieces. Cook the bacon in a large pot over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate and pour off most of the grease, leaving a tbsp or two in the pot. While the bacon is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Peel and slice the carrots and slice the celery. Sauté the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in the leftover bacon grease over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes). Use the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve the browned bits of bacon from the bottom of the pot. While the vegetables are sautéing, peel the potatoes then cut them into half-inch cubes. Drain the soaked beans in a colander and rinse them briefly. Add the cubed potatoes, rinsed beans and chicken broth to the pot. Cover the pot and bring it up to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and let the pot boil gently for one hour, or until the beans and potatoes are very soft. Use an immersion blender to purée about half of the soup, leaving some beans and vegetables whole. If you don't have an immersion blender, remove half of the soup from the pot, let it cool slightly, then use a blender or food processor to carefully puree the warm soup. Return the puréed soup to the pot and stir to combine with the rest. Add the tomato sauce and reserved bacon to the soup. Stir and heat until warm. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

After making another Lifetime film titled \"How She Caught a Killer,\" she plays the title role in the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries feature \"Guiding Emily\" Friday, Sept. 8. The telecast helps to mark National Dog Service Month, for a reason that's quite clear in the story.Based on the same-named book by Barbara Hinske, the film's Emily is a successful career woman who experiences a major crisis when an accident robs her of her eyesight. Struggling to adjust to the situation, she gets a helper in a canine named Garth (whose thoughts are voiced by \"Will & Grace\" alum Eric McCormack), who is undergoing his own transition as he trains to become a guide dog and the two of them grow and benefit from each other as their symbiotic relationship develops. Antonio Cupo (\"Blood & Treasure\") and Sharon Taylor (\"Nancy Drew\") also are in the cast.In a statement she released before the SAG-AFTRA actors' strike, Drew said, \"Shooting 'Guiding Emily' was a deeply moving experience that allowed me to enter into the blind and partially sighted community in a very powerful way. We were honored to have two actresses from the community play roles in the film, and sitting with them both and hearing their stories was transformative for me and for our crew.\" \"I was also honored to visit the Guide Dogs of America open house the weekend before we started shooting,\" Drew noted, \"and was able to tour the facility and learn all about the process for raising service dogs and the sacrifice puppy raisers make to train them for two years, and then send them off to a member of the blind and partially sighted community to partner with them.\" \n \n Caption: Sarah Drew in \"One Summer,\" another Hallmark movie \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each had a vase in hand and carefully reviewed the bundles of flowers they had to create their bouquets.\nHoopes said gardening and flowers have healed and changed her life. She seeks to bring that same joy to the people of the Eastern Shore.\nThis was not where she thought her life was heading. In 2015, Hoopes had a career in human resources. Due to health challenges, she turned to gardening and flowers to help her heal.\nShe decided that she wanted to be a flower farmer, and she shared her dream with her family.\n\"It seemed far-fetched at the time, but it was my husband who said I should follow my dreams — he was all in,\" Hoopes said. \"We moved and built our flower farm in Oxford. My daughters asked me why I didn't do this when they were younger. They were so excited.\"\nShe left her career in human resources. The Hoopes built a house on a quarter acre dedicated to her flower farm, which she named Oopsy Daisy Farm.\nThrough her interest in flowers, she met Samantha McCall, a fellow garden enthusiast, floral designer and her soon-to-be business partner and dear friend. They began sharing their dreams of opening their shop and made moves to make it happen. Hoopes said it happened quickly. It was an idea in December, and by March, they were in business.\nTogether, they shared their love for fresh, local and specialty flowers with the Eastern Shore. Their business grew, and even through the pandemic, they adapted by delivering hand-tied bouquets curbside to customers and avoided supply chain issues by growing local flowers.\nDue to health issues, McCall had to step away from the business in 2021. McCall and Hoopes remain best friends and are a support system for each other.\nToday, Chesapeake Bloom is in its fifth year of thriving. Hoopes said Chesapeake Bloom is an all-women business operated by five flower enthusiasts.\n\"I feel lucky to work with such motivated, smart and hardworking ladies here,\" said Madeline Poe, floral designer for Chesapeake Bloom. \"We have a great team. … This job really has been a blessing because this is where I feel at home.\"\nDuring the flower bar on Friday, Poe guided attendees to create unique and beautiful bouquets. Working alongside Pam Keeton, co-worker and master gardener, they trimmed and cut fresh flowers for attendees.\n\"It's a cheerful place,\" Keeton said. \"It's a great way to meet like-minded people. We all like to garden. Most of us are into conservation and horticulture.\"\nHoopes said she is proud of her team and business and believes that if women want to open their own businesses, they should do so with faith in themselves. Hoopes said that women tend to be hesitant to take on challenges or changes, but if they don't try, they will never succeed.\n\"This is a second act for me, and I absolutely love it,\" Hoopes said. \"I have two daughters, and if I could tell them to do it, I would say to do it. I would say go have your own business because I love it. It challenges you every day, every aspect of it at the same time. I don't think I would do anything different.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The room was packed with concerned citizens and surrounding business owners Wednesday.\nMajor concerns the board continued to address with the developers included traffic impact on Maryland Route 8, entrance and exit access, and architectural issues.\nThe proposal is not before the County Commissioners for a vote, and due to subsequent comments from the planning commission that must be addressed, the Royal Farms project is not expected to be placed on an agenda for some time, Moredock said.\nBay Bridge Cove residents and members of the Homeowners Association there plan to seek information about a potential county ordinance to prevent gas stations within 500 feet of a day care center, Tamburrino said.\nResidents are also compiling data and crash statistics to prepare for the next meeting, according to Tamburrino.\nMore information and updates can be found on the Planning and Zoning Department section of the county website at qac.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A Shore Senator': Friends, colleagues reflect on contributions of the late Sen. Rich Colburn\n\n December 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1023\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Community members and politicians alike are reflecting on the vast impact former state Sen. Rich Colburn had on the Eastern Shore. The longtime legislator died Friday. He was 74.Colburn has been described as consistent, relentless and committed to both his work in Annapolis as a legislator and his involvement in local communities, according to family, peers and friends.\nDave Wilson, chairman of Preston Automotive Group, called Colburn a \"true friend.\" Wilson recalled that the late senator constantly reached out, offering help and always following through.\nA campaign slogan Colburn used, \"A Shore Senator,\" promised dependability and care for the people of the region. Wilson says Colburn's life shows he made true on that promise.\n\"Some slogans people don't live by,\" Wilson said. \"He lived by his. He represented everybody on the Shore.\"\nColburn, a Republican, spent 28 years in Annapolis. He served as a state senator for 20 years after eight years in the House of Delegates. His district covered Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties.\nFormer colleagues, legislators and those who knew his work spoke highly of his commitment to his constituents. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said Colburn was a \"fearless leader\" in the statehouse and a \"relentless\" politician.\n\"He was a master at all things Annapolis, and that was an expertise that he developed,\" Mautz said. \"(It was) something he was willing to share with anybody that was willing to listen and learn.\"\nCONSTITUENT SERVICEBorn in Oxford in 1950, Colburn grew up on the Eastern Shore. He graduated from Easton High School in 1968. After school, he joined the U.S. Army and served during the Cold War. He stayed for three years and earned the rank of sergeant.\nThe late senator worked at the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, now SuperFresh, for 25 years, and he served as Federalsburg's town manager for 24 years.\nAs his political career took off, he maintained connections across Mid-Shore counties. While Talbot County was his birthplace, he worked in Caroline and lived in Dorchester counties.\nJeannie Haddaway-Riccio, a former House of Delegates member who worked with Colburn while he was a senator, said he was an \"incredible mentor.\" Haddaway-Riccio said his commitment to watermen and farmers on the Eastern Shore was unmatched.\n\"He really had what I would call an unrivaled work ethic, particularly when it came to fighting for his constituents and helping them with the issues that they had,\" she said.\nFour years after his time in the House of Delegates ended, Colburn won his first Senate term, assuming the seat from the retired Democratic Sen. Frederick C. Malkus Jr. in 1995.\nLen Foxwell, a veteran political and campaign strategist, worked with Colburn on multiple campaigns, but also worked for an opposing campaign during the 1994 election. Foxwell says keeping up with Colburn was impossible.\n\"In his prime, he was unbeatable because he simply outflanked, outhustled and outworked his opposition,\" Foxwell said.\nColburn won four additional terms before falling to Republican opponent and former state Sen. Addie Eckardt in the 2014 primary for the Senate seat.\nEckardt says Colburn was a master campaigner.\n\"He stayed out in front of his community, fighting for the very Eastern Shore conservative values,\" she said. \"He's very persistent and intentional in what he does because he's been a real student of government and politics and history.\"\nColburn played a large role in pushing forward many infrastructure projects on the Eastern Shore, including the Dover Bridge that connects Caroline and Talbot counties. He helped secure funding for the bridge, a process that took decades of advocacy.\nParty lines didn't slow Colburn down, colleagues say. Instead, his ability to work across the aisle and respect the process of government allowed him to successfully serve his constituents for decades.\n\"Nobody in elected office ever fought harder for the Eastern Shore than Rich Colburn,\" Foxwell said.\nCOMMUNITY IMPACTColburn was a consistent mentor and friend in life, many have said since his sudden death Friday.\nWhether it was attending events at local fire halls, serving as post commander for American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge or rooting on his favorite baseball team, the Baltimore Orioles, Colburn was a familiar face who loved his community.\n\"As the Commander of the Dorchester Post 91 American Legion, he was a pillar of strength and a guiding light for all who knew him,\" Post 91 said in a Facebook post. \"His steadfast commitment to honoring veterans and fostering unity within the Legion will never be forgotten.\"\n\"His leadership and love for Oxford, where he was raised, and the entire district left a lasting mark on our community,\" former Oxford Town Commissioner Jimmy Jaramillo said in a statement. \"I'm grateful for his guidance and support over the years.\"\nDorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer said in a statement, \"I will truly miss our rambling inside baseball conversations and his wry sense of humor as a friend, and I will also miss his advice and mentorship as someone who is trying to follow the same path that he walked: trying to make (a) mark by trying to make a difference.\"\nColburn is survived by his wife of over 20 years, Alma Colburn, daughter Johanna Hamilton and son-in-law Bobby Hamilton, and granddaughter Saylor. Alma Colburn said 7-year-old Saylor was the joy of his life, as they often traveled to and from North Carolina to spend time with her.\nDave Wilson of Preston Automotive Group said Colburn never forgot to call him on Feb. 9, their shared birthday. Small gestures such as that yearly phone call, or their love for the Orioles, will forever be remembered.\n\"That's what I'm going to miss the most,\" Wilson said. \"I'm going to miss those Feb. 9 calls.\"\nIn Wilson's experience, Colburn extended his help for issues small and large. When the Preston dealership suffered a massive fire in 2000, the state senator was one of the first to help. That knack for serving the community was never-ending, says Wilson.\n\"His legacy will live on,\" Wilson said. \"He was the perfect person to represent the Shore and be part of the Shore. He just really was. When we look back on it, if there was a Hall of Fame for that, he should be in it.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the relatives of Sen. Rich Colburn. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Banquet at Washington College for Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.The event was put on by the MLK Joint Committee, which is made up of Minary's Dream Alliance, Chester Valley Ministers Association, Washington College Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, the Kent County NAACP and Kent County Parks and Recreation.\nDoncella Wilson, co-executive director of Minary's Dream Alliance, said a variety of community members — from elected officials to students — come out for this event every year.\n\"So it's a good representation of what the community truly looks like,\" she said.\nThe celebration kicked off with a breakfast at Hodson Hall Dining Hall. After that, attendees walked over to the Decker Theatre at the Gibson Center for the Arts on campus to hear speeches and watch performances.\nThe program opened with a reenactment of the Greensboro Four, a group of college students in North Carolina protesting segregation laws through staging a sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter.\nSinging resounded through the theater at various times throughout the program, including a performance of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" often referred to as the Black National Anthem, by Amiya Potts and a performance by singer, songwriter and author Ty Bolden, singing her song \"Free Woman.\"\nJamie \"Mixx\" Barrett was awarded the Commissioner William W.

Tue asked the students questions about their takes on King's legacy.\nPat Nugent, the Miller Director of Civic Engagement at the Starr Center, said getting younger people involved helps to pass on the legacy.\n\"And that's really what the day is about,\" he said. \"To infuse younger generations with a sense of civic duty and obligation, as well as to connect them to generations of folks who have been doing that in Kent County for decades.\"\nThe keynote speaker of the program, Jermichael Mitchell, a writer, philanthropist and community activist who ran for mayor of Salisbury this past year, talked about purpose.\n\"No matter what your age may be, young or old, every last one of us is born with a purpose,\" he said. \"Every last one of us is born to do something in this world. And in order for us to live our dreams, we have to actually know that purpose and embody that purpose and move forward.\"\nMitchell talked about King \"walking in his purpose\" every day, no matter what he faced.\nShaila Parker, who attended the event said its important that King is recognized every year because he did so much to help unify people.\n\"(He) helped make sure everyone has access to different things, has rights, is respected, has dignity,\" she said.\nLisa Moody, who has been attending the event since 2017, said one thing special about Kent County is that when there is an event, the county comes out for it.\n\"So it's a great place to meet people or reunite with people,\" she said. \"And of course with today being the MLK holiday, it's a good reason for us to all come together for a specific purpose.\"\nSaturday, Jan. 20, at 3:30 p.m., the public is invited to back to Decker Theatre to watch the premiere of \"Get on The Bus,\" a documentary that follows local students and community members take a journey from Chestertown to The Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama to deliver historic materials. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Democratic lawmakers plan to crack down on youth crime in the coming weeks\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 587\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Children as young as 10 could potentially go to court for auto thefts and handgun violations, under one proposal key Democratic lawmakers detailed on Wednesday and plan to push for in the legislature in coming weeks.The lawmakers propose giving Juvenile Services officers the option to route a young person's case to court if the child is 10 to 13 years of age and accused of these or other crimes — adding them to the list of serious offenses that already can land a young person before a judge.\nThe proposals are meant to promote collaboration and make the system work more smoothly, Democratic officials said, but youth advocates worry that they will lead to higher incarceration rates, especially of youth of color.\n\"Right now, juvenile offenders and the services and accountability they need are separated by an abundance of confusion,\" said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County. \"Egos, political agendas and arguments over process have filled the gaps.\"\nThere must be \"accountability for adults in the system, who are charged with administering the system,\" said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City. \"We must ensure that all parts are working to their highest potential.\"\nJones and Ferguson joined Democratic Gov. Wes Moore on Wednesday for a public announcement of the proposals, alongside the lawmakers who crafted them.\nThe raft of changes, if enacted, would toughen a reform law the state legislature passed in 2022. Among other things, that reform barred police from charging young people under 13 except when they are accused of the most serious crimes.\nThe newly unveiled legislative package would expand that list of serious crimes and lengthen the maximum probation period that can be ordered by a judge. It would also expand the reporting responsibilities of a state agency charged with oversight of the youth justice system.\nThe announcement on Wednesday gave shape to Democrats' response to pleas for accountability amid spikes in certain youth offenses in recent years. While youth violent crime arrests fell 16.5% overall between fiscal years 2020 and 2023, according to a Juvenile Services report last year, carjackings increased by 85.4% and handgun violations rose almost 220%.\nAfter weeks of talks with law enforcement and advocates, the set of proposals represents a general agreement among Democrats, who control both chambers of the legislature and also hold the governor's office.\nBut advocates in the Maryland Youth Justice Coalition predicted in a written statement that the \"legislation introduced today will see thousands more kids incarcerated every year, particularly Black and brown children, and (exacerbate) the already serious racial disparities in Maryland's juvenile justice system.\"\nAs the minority party, Republicans have said in recent months that the reform law leaves Marylanders less safe and also prevents young people from getting the services they need. GOP lawmakers in Annapolis have their own ideas for change, including a measure that would prohibit young people who have committed sexual offenses from attending school in person.\nBut one key Republican on Wednesday said the Democrats' plan shows they are taking \"first steps\" in addressing flaws in the youth justice system. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, said he appreciates that Moore has put his weight behind the issue of youth crime.\n\"For him to be able to step in and say, 'Hey, I'm a Democrat. I'm from Baltimore City, but I'm going to step up and say too much is too much and this is a reasonable way to deal with this' — it's incredibly helpful,\" Buckel said.\nBuckel said he also hopes Moore will be able to persuade fellow Democrats to consider other tough ideas, too. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There's certainly, there are plenty of people that attend that put the content out on social media,\" Kelledes said.\nThe town of Greensboro's plan is to have another form of video up after the investigation has been conducted and they receive recommendations on what software is good to use to conduct meetings without interruption.\n\"We're just trying to get through the investigation and see what the FBI tells us and what they recommend,\" Kelledes said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Cooking for The King\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1061\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's column is being written from the heart. The month of August is always a busy month, but not too busy for me to reflect on the past.Those of you who know me also know this is the month I usually travel to Memphis and meet with worldwide friends to gather at Graceland and pay respects to Elvis.\nAug. 16, 1977 was the day we teenagers of the late 1950s and '60s lost one of our favorite idols. Hard to believe it's been 48 years since I heard the news that morning. As goes with all our idols, Elvis is just as popular today with fans of all ages.\nMy answer to those who ask why I liked him so much is easy to explain: My older siblings loved the late 1940s through the mid-1950s music, and when I became a preteen, my generation needed a change of dance styles and rock 'n' roll music. And we got it — to the horror of our elders. That is true for all generations.\nWhen I meet fans from Germany, some are my age, but some are 30 and 40 years old and remembering their grandparents and parents talking about Elvis serving in the Army in Germany.\nLet's explore some of the King's favorite foods. Elvis loved his mother's meatloaf, and I occasionally make this recipe.\nMEATLOAF\n2 lbs ground beef, one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, two minced cloves garlic, 4 oz crushed saltines, 8-oz can crushed tomatoes, 8-oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together ground beef with onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed saltines and crushed tomatoes. Mix well and form into a loaf and place in a baking pan. Bake covered, for 45 minutes. In the meantime, mix tomato sauce and ketchup and set aside. After 45 minutes of baking, remove the meatloaf and pour the ketchup on top and return to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes and serve with mashed potatoes.\nROAST BEEF\n2 tbsps black pepper, 1 1/2 tbsps salt, 2 tbsps garlic, 6 lb beef, 1 1/2 cups water.\nMix pepper, salt and garlic to form a paste and rub on this mixture on the beef. Place this roast in a baking pan, add water and place in a 350-degree oven. Bake for about 4 hours or until tender. You can steam some fresh vegetables to serve with the roast.\nSPANISH OMELETTE\n4 eggs, 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, salt and pepper.\nBeat eggs well and mix in bell pepper and onion. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded cheese of your choice with salt and pepper to taste. Cook in a greased skillet for about 4 minutes.\nHAMBURGER STEAK ELVIS\n2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHES\nSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES\n1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBefore I close the column today, I need to honor my late brother, Staff Sgt. (E6) Ollie L. Hitchens Jr., who would be celebrating his 78th birthday on Aug. 15. Ollie served 20 years in the U.S. Army and pulled three tours of duty in Vietnam.\nOllie and I had a lot in common — our likes, dislikes, love for Chevy cars, love of family, patriotic responsibilities, personalities and love for Elvis.\nOllie loved our mom's old-fashioned cooking and often wrote home about how he missed it. While on his many trips home Mom would make sure to have those foods ready — fried chicken, pot roast, pork chops, mashed potatoes, fried liver with gravy, chicken and dumplings, fresh lima beans with tomatoes, corn and potatoes and of course homemade biscuits. I have shared many of these recipes with you in previous columns.\nRest in peace, brother — as I always say, \"All gave some, and some gave all.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lost sign finds its way back to Dorchester's Old Trinity Church\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 503\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHURCH CREEK — Members of the small congregation of Old Trinity Church, Maryland's oldest active church, were surprised to see one of Old Trinity's former signs being sold at auction this month.After the sign sold to the highest bidder, the congregation thought it was gone for good.\nBut the following Sunday, The Rev. Dan Dunlap walked into the vesting room of John's Chapel, the other church he serves, where he was greeted by the sign. A close friend of Dunlap's heard about the auction, tracked the sign down, and bought it for Dunlap.\n\"I said, 'I'm just overwhelmed, I'm humbled.' I mean, it was such a gift,\" Dunlap said.\nGage Thomas, a collector of Dorchester County artifacts who sold the sign to Dunlap's friend at the Aug. 23 Foxwell Auction, said he was happy the sign had been returned to Old Trinity. \"It's a historical location in Dorchester County. I'm happy that the sign has made its way back to there,\" Thomas said.\nOld Trinity Church predates its relationship with the Anglican Church and the creation of the Episcopal Diocese. It was built through private funds roughly a decade before the establishment of the Episcopal Church, Dunlap said.\nThe church has undergone multiple iterations and bore several names, initially being called The Church of Dorchester Parish. In 1853, it was renamed Trinity. Community members referred to it as \"the old church,\" and over time, the name \"Old Trinity\" stuck.\nThe small, red-brick church building was built around 1670 and was restored to its original colonial style in the 1950s. The restoration was made possible by legacy funds bequeathed to the church, which are now held in accounts to accrue interest.\n\"I've served at a number of churches, but I've never really been part of a church quite like this that felt that its roots were in this community,\" Dunlap said.\nThe sign was not the church's original sign. It came along sometime in the centuries after, though Dunlap did not know exactly when.\nDunlap said it was a strange feeling when he saw how much the sign was sold for. He figured the old piece of painted wood that was likely thrown in the trash would sell for maybe $100.\nThomas said he bought the sign about 15 years ago for $200. This time around, the sign was sold for $400.\n\"My first thought was, 'I didn't realize we were that important,'\" Dunlap said.\nAfter that initial thought passed, a weird feeling sank in. \"But not all bad. I mean, I wasn't troubled by it, I was just confused by it,\" Dunlap said. \"And then just to see it the next Sunday, waiting for me at the vesting area of the other church, I was just I, I shed a tear. I just couldn't believe it.\"\nFor Dunlap, the sign being sold at auction has highlighted the church's importance to the community.\n\"The church is here for people to come and to enjoy it, to add their story to our story. That's why you can't say who owns Old Trinity,\" Dunlap said. \"It's the community's church.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candy hearts and other Valentine's treats\n\n February 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1552\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The big day is here, and the traditions of flowers and chocolates still holds their spots as number one favorites for all ages.My favorite Valentine's Day memories are of the elementary school parties — the cute cards and little candy hearts. The girls would gather and compare the message candies from the boys.\nWhat fun that was. Then came high school, and the stakes were higher. The cute juvenile cards turned into single rose buds and candy.\nNo matter how you celebrate this special day — with or without candy — just tell that special person (or persons) \"happy Valentine's Day.\"\nHEART SHAPED PIZZA\n1 pound store-bought pizza dough, 1 tbsp olive oil (plus more for brushing), 16 slices pepperoni, All-purpose flour (for dusting), 1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce, 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella. Put the pizza dough in a medium bowl and coat well with the olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, put a large inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Fold a pepperoni slice in half and use a pair of kitchen shears to trim the edges into the shape of half of a heart. When you unfold the pepperoni slice, it will be a whole heart. Repeat this process with the remaining pepperoni, then set aside.\nDivide the pizza dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, stretch 1 ball of dough into a 10-inch round. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper, then slide the parchment and dough onto a second inverted baking sheet. Use a pair of kitchen shears or a paring knife to cut the pizza dough into the shape of a large heart, discarding the dough scraps. Spread half of the sauce on the dough in a thin layer and scatter half of the mozzarella on top. Top with half of the pepperoni slices. Use a pastry brush to brush the exposed edges of the dough with olive oil. Carefully slide the parchment onto the preheated baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make a second pizza.\nSURF AND TURF\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, 2 tbsps chopped fresh chives, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, 6 jumbo shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails intact), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon, 2 tsps chopped fresh thyme (plus 2 to 3 sprigs), freshly ground pepper, 6 slices pancetta (about 2 ounces), 1 10-ounce piece beef tenderloin (trimmed), sea salt, 8 asparagus spears, 1 tbsp unsalted butter. Pulse the parsley, chives and olive oil in a mini food processor until smooth. Thin with water, if necessary, and add 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and set aside. (This can be done up to 2 hours ahead.)\nToss the shrimp, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped thyme and pepper to taste in a bowl. Wrap each shrimp with a piece of pancetta. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the shrimp on a foil-lined broiler pan. Season the beef with sea salt and pepper, press the thyme sprigs into the meat and set aside. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Put the asparagus in a microwave-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and a pinch of sea salt. Heat a medium ovenproof skillet over high heat and add the butter. When the foam subsides, sear the beef until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold the meat and brown the sides. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook until a thermometer inserted into the beef registers 125 degrees for medium rare, about 4 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest while you cook the shrimp. Broil the shrimp until the pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, microwave the asparagus until tender, about 2 minutes. Slice the beef into 4 pieces. Serve with the shrimp, herb oil and asparagus.\nCLASSIC SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS\n1 pound spaghetti, 1 pound ground beef, 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley, 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (plus more for serving), 1 large egg, 2 garlic cloves (minced), Kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup onion (finely chopped), 1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes, 1 bay leaf, freshly ground black pepper.\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain. In a large bowl, combine beef with breadcrumbs, parsley, parmesan, egg, garlic, 1 tsp salt and red pepper flakes. Mix until just combined, then form into 16 balls. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate. Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to pot and cover. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve pasta with a healthy scoop of meatballs and sauce.\nVALENTINES DAY SUGAR COOKIES\n2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting), 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (at room temperature), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1 large egg. For Icing: 3 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsps milk, 1 1/2 tsps pure vanilla extract, red gel food coloring, pink gel food coloring, sprinkles (optional). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nFor the cookies: Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture and mix until well combined, scraping down sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, about 2 minutes.\nDivide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper until it's about 1/8-inch thick. Using heart-shaped cookie cutters, cut the dough and place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart (a small off-set spatula is really helpful when transferring the cookies). After both pieces of dough have been rolled out and cut, combine the dough scraps and re-roll and cut to utilize as much of the dough as possible. Bake until the cookies are just barely golden around the edges, rotating halfway through, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.\nFor the icing: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. The consistency should be similar to that of slightly thinned yogurt and should coat the back of a spoon. Adjust with additional confectioners' sugar or milk, if needed. Place 2 tbsps of icing into each of 2 small bowls. Add 4 drops of red gel food coloring to one bowl and 2 drops of pink gel food coloring to the other and stir until fully incorporated. Using a small spoon, drizzle a small amount of each color over the white icing and then repeatedly drag a toothpick through the icing until you create a marbled effect.\nWorking with one cooled cookie at a time, carefully dip it face-side down into the icing and allow any excess to drip off before placing the cooking back on the cooling rack. Add additional red and pink icing to the bigger bowl of icing as needed to maintain the marbling effect.\nHOMEMADE CANDY HEARTS\n1 1/4-ounce packet unflavored gelatin powder, 1 tbsp light corn syrup, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp salt, 2 1-pound boxes confectioners' sugar (plus more for kneading), assorted food coloring (for tinting), assorted extracts (such as peppermint, strawberry or almond) for flavoring, cooking spray. Whisk the gelatin, corn syrup, vanilla, salt and 1/2 cup boiling water in a stand mixer bowl until the gelatin dissolves. Using the paddle attachment, beat in the confectioners' sugar on medium-low speed, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff, sticky dough.\nTransfer the dough to a clean surface and knead, adding more confectioners' sugar as needed (up to 1 cup), until the dough is smooth, pliable and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Flatten 1 piece into a disk. (Cover the rest with plastic wrap.) Add a few drops each of food coloring and extract to the center of the dough; fold in the sides and pinch closed, then knead until the color is distributed.\nLightly coat a large piece of parchment paper with cooking spray. Roll out the colored dough on the parchment until 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into hearts using 1-inch cookie cutters; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, using different colors and extracts. Let the hearts sit at room temperature, uncovered, until dry and hard, about 24 hours, flipping them halfway through. Write messages on the hearts using food decorating pens. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Gluten-Free Tourism: Destinations catering to dietary restrictions\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jessica Clark Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Celiac Disease Foundation estimates one out of every 100 Americans deal with celiac disease, with untold millions more having gluten sensitivity.2024 is set to become a blockbuster year for the travel industry. But what do you do when dietary restrictions complicate travel? For gluten-free people, the world of travel may not be as complicated as they think.\nWith the constant rise in gluten intolerance, more people are demanding gluten-free options when they travel abroad, creating an entirely new sector of business for countries that may not have even considered it in decades past.\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the gluten-free market brought in 12.3 billion dollars in 2023 and is projected to increase an average of 10.1% per year through 2032. Europe has a 6.9 billion dollar gluten-free industry, also growing each year. But gluten-free foods aren't mainstream enough for people to eat with confidence anywhere they go. At least not yet.\nNavigating the Airport\nTSA allows flyers to bring dry food and snacks through the airport in their carry-on. Rather than risk the possible difficulty of finding gluten-free foods in an airport, consider bringing homemade gluten-free snacks. Grab some gluten-free crackers, fresh fruit, or gluten-free granola bars and toss them in your bag.\nWhile people should still research gluten-free restaurants in each airport, having something on hand will save a bad situation in a pinch.\nEating out With Celiac or Gluten Sensitivity\nWhen dining out, question servers about ingredients used to ensure they are gluten-free. Some surprising foods contain gluten, so asking the waitstaff before ordering is critical. In some cases, it can be appropriate to ask to speak to the chef.\nEmese Maczko of Eco Lodges Anywhere says, \"I think it is easier to eat gluten-free than it was 10-20 years ago. But you still need to plan ahead. You cannot just wing it. I never go to a place without having a list of places I can eat with locations saved on my phone. Cities are easier since there are more choices.\n\" Road trips and the countryside are harder. Despite Italy being famous for its pizza and pasta, I was surprised by the number and quality of gluten-free foods I found in restaurants. But I searched them online in advance. I would not have found them by just walking around.\"\nWhen possible, book a room or place to stay with a kitchen. Even a small kitchen can help when gluten-free foods are hard to find. A quick trip to a local market offers an abundance of gluten-free, fresh foods you can cook where you are staying.\nGluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nOrganizations have popped up worldwide to offer help to those traveling with celiac disease. Explorers can reach out to them directly for assistance in navigating their country with Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.\nItaly for the Win\nRome, Italy, was named the number one choice for gluten-free eating by Your Celiac Guide.\nItaly, as a whole, is making strides in providing gluten-free options thanks to its Associazione Italiana Celiachia APS organization, known in English as the Italian Celiac Association. An organization that trains restaurants countrywide to cater safely to celiac needs. They provide training and workshops to chefs on cooking techniques, cross-contamination, and more.\nMore Gluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nLondon, England, with its fifteen dedicated gluten-free restaurants and bakeries, is another excellent choice for those with gluten issues. Their celiac organization, called Coeliac UK, does the same as its Italian counterpart, though without being government-backed.\nDublin, Ireland, and Edinburgh, Scotland, in addition to Hungary and Australia, deserve recognition.\nBella Bucchiotti, a travel writer at xoxoBella, says, \"As an avid traveler and someone with celiac disease, I found that Greece, French Polynesia, and Germany were great for finding gluten-free options. When you're traveling abroad, it's smart to do some research on the local food and traditional gluten-free dishes beforehand.\n\"While I've usually been able to find gluten-free food in most countries, I did face some difficulties in rural parts of Thailand and Peru due primarily to language barriers. To deal with those situations, I always bring gluten-free snacks and cards explaining my dietary needs in the local language, which helps me communicate in restaurants.\"\nDon't Stay Home\nGluten issues should never prevent people from enjoying global travel. Though gluten intolerance can add an extra step to excursions, those with food sensitivities shouldn't stay at home. With some forethought, planning, and research, travelers with dietary restrictions can find safe, gluten-free meals anywhere their heart might take them.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planning Commission debates resolutions on Lakeside development\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1198\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON-A multihour meeting of the Talbot County Planning Commission on Wednesday tackled a trio of comprehensive water and sewer plan amendments relating to the Lakeside at Trappe development, concluding with one finding of inconsistency and two postponements.The benches in the Bradley Meeting Room were packed as the five-member planning commission mulled numerous public comments on the three resolutions proposed by the Talbot County Council over the last several months.Because the legislation amends the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan, the council sought recommendations on Resolutions 338, 347 and 348 from the public works advisory board and the planning commission. The council's own public hearings on the resolutions are scheduled for its Oct. 24 meeting.Over a dozen letters commenting on the three resolutions were submitted to the planning commission prior to Wednesday's meeting, with more comments unfolding over the course of the morning.Concerns with the long-contested development centered on Lakeside's size, the capacity of its new wastewater treatment plant, negative environmental impacts, preservation of Talbot County's rural character and Trappe's sewer service maps. Planning commissioners raised their own contentions with the resolutions as well.RESOLUTION 338Introduced in late February by Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke, the resolution would amend the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan to be consistent with the Maryland Department of the Environment's discharge permit for Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.The resolution would mandate that any future expansion of the new wastewater treatment plant require a comprehensive water and sewer plan amendment.The discharge permit, issued last October, is limited to the project's first phase and allows for an annual average flow of 100,000 gallons per day, or roughly250 gallons per day per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU), allowing only 400 residential units to be built.But according to the development's attorney Ryan Showalter, who testified at Thursday's meeting, the 250 gallon per day flow is a presumed flow for initial allocation of capacity and treatment. Once the plant is operational, the 100,000 gallon capacity is more likely to serve 500 to 600 houses, he said.A total of 2,501 residences are planned for the development.Showalter expressed opposition to the requirement for the developer to come back before the county for future expansion.\"The developer understands the requirement to go through a major permit modification; that process involves public hearings, public input, the County Council certainly can weigh in and comment on that, but the notion that every time the Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is required to expand, (and) should come back before the county for a water and sewer plan amendment-which is maybe another four-year process - is not acceptable to the developer,\" he said, adding: \"We would not oppose 338 if that sentence was stricken.\"Alan Girard, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Eastern Shore director, said the nonprofit was supportive of the resolution's intent, but questions remained as to whether the intent could be achieved as it related to the timing of development criteria.\"The resolution rightly requires an amendment to the sewer plan when a major permit modification is sought, but it's mostly silent on other timing key elements, like the sewer service area maps, the 540,000 gallon per day discharge quantity and phasing, the automatic change to 'immediate priority service status' when the land is annexed,\" he said. \"These timing elements are significant because they're linked to the major concerns the public has with this project.\"Girard urged the Planning Commission to work with the County Council to ensure the legislation's full intent was realized by updating the sewer service classifications in ways that best serve the community and environmental health.Lyndsey Ryan, Trappe's town attorney, raised similar concerns to those voiced by Showalter.\"The town feels that this is overly cumbersome and would impede their ability to smartly manage growth and orderly provide adequate public facilities for development within the Town of Trappe,\" she said.RESOLUTION 347Resolution 347, introduced on Sept. 12, was spurred by MDE's request for the number of equivalent dwelling units for all phases of the Lakeside development.The legislation provides the number of EDUs - 2,874 in total -for all six phases of the development, though the numbers for Phases 2 through 6 are estimated. The legislation includes the current water and sewer classifications.Points of concern voiced by members of the public centered on confusion with timing of the phases and water and sewer classifications for each phase.Ryan, again speaking for the Town of Trappe, said she thought there was a lot of misunderstanding about phases and planning of phases. The town never intended to require that each phase be developed before moving to a later phase; the phases were not intended to be sequential, she said.Ryan also confirmed that 81 residential units within Lakeside are being served and are connected to Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant.On Monday, the county's public works advisory board voted 5-0 to recommend that the resolution not be adopted as written.RESOLUTION 348Resolution 348, introduced Sept. 12, was also drafted in response to MDE's request for clarification on Trappe's water and sewer service maps. The legislation addresses incorrect water and sewer classifications of parcels shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281, the original legislation approving a wastewater treatment plant for Lakeside under a draft discharge permit.The parcels that were incorrectly shown on the exhibits are unrelated to Resolution 281. The parcels' classifications were not changed, making the resolution's purpose solely to clarify and confirm the water and sewer classifications.To Easton resident Lisa Ghezzi, a former county planning commission member, the resolution signified continued confusion on Trappe's water and sewer service maps. She pointed out that the lack of updates to the county's comprehensive plan is the source of the frustration.\"We're just spinning our wheels, and we cannot make any decisions until everyone, staff included, knows the facts behind this,\" she said. \"I found confusion in staff's presentation at the outset of this discussion. (The) public works advisory board raised questions earlier this week. How can we operate like this?\"Talbot County resident Mike McConnel urged the Planning Commission to consider a revised sewer service map for Trappe that only identifies one small section of Lakeside as an immediate priority and to revert all other sections of the development to unprogrammed.\"That will mean that as Lakeside progresses, they will have to come back to the Planning Commission and establish that the consequences of the development are consistent as it goes forward,\" he said.The county's public works advisory board reviewed the resolution on Monday, but tabled a decision until the board's next meeting on Oct. 19.DECISIONSAfter significant back and forth, the Planning Commission voted 3-2 to find Resolution 338 inconsistent with the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan because it refers to a map that needs to be reviewed, but the commission endorsed the idea of a phased review, per the motion made.The commission voted unanimously to postpone its determination on Resolution 347 for further discussion.As for Resolution 348, the commission also voted unanimously to postpone consideration due to ongoing uncertainty that has not been addressed. \n \n Caption: NATALlE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County Planning Commission Chairman Chip Councell, center, speaks about the Lakeside comprehensive water and sewer plan amendments during a meeting Wednesday, Oct. 4. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The result quickly became a legendary piece of television, and Paramount+ looks back at it in the new offering \"Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,\" which starts streaming Tuesday, Aug, 15 - the night before the 46th anniversary of Presley's death, and following the project's limited showings in movie theaters globally.While incorporating many segments from the original show, \"Reinventing Elvis\" examines Presley's relationship not only with Binder (who narrates the bulk of the film), but also with Col. Tom Parker, the famously strict manager who kept tight control over Presley.Singers Darius Rucker and Drake Milligan are among those who offer comments, along with journalist Alanna Nash and Anita Mann, who was a dancer on the 1968 special.Also an executive producer of \"Reinventing Elvis,\" Binder maintains that he's \"real pleased with what they did\" creatively with the documentary, though he admits he was skeptical at first. \"When I was approached to get involved, I said, 'There are so many third-party stories about Elvis, why do we need another one?' Then they pitched me their idea, and it really covered 1968 as a whole. I was rooting for them from the sidelines, and I certainly was responsive to any of their requests for more material.\" Music-documentary veteran John Scheinfeld - who also has done projects on John Lennon, John Coltrane, Herb Alpert and Harry Nilsson - directed \"Reinventing Elvis,\" which also has music-industry legend Spencer Proffer, a longtime Binder associate, as the executive producer who conceived it.\"There are so few of us alive today who were there when it all happened,\" Binder reflects of the 1968 Elvis show. \"There have been specials and books about it, but I never felt that anybody who was there told the real story.\"I was there from the beginning to the end, and it's so gratifying today to realize what the public response to it was. A number of years ago, somebody approached me and said, 'Steve, you realize that no matter what you did in the past or do from here on in, you'll be remembered mostly for the Elvis comeback special' and I think they told the truth.\" The entirety of \"Reinventing Elvis\" serves as a reminder of how major a star Presley was in his time. \"We're so lucky that we partnered with Paramount+,\" Binder notes, \"because many of Elvis' movies were done at Paramount, so we were given access to their library and were able to include clips from his films.That was just a stroke of luck, and it sure adds to this. None of the other projects that have been done about the 1968 special were able to clear those rights, I guess.\" \n \n Caption: Elvis Presley in his 1968 comeback special \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Reese has LSU in contention for a second straight national championship. Bueckers is finally healthy and doing things on the court for UConn reminiscent of her freshman season when she was the AP Player of the Year.\nThrow in a few stellar freshmen like JuJu Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo and the game is reaching heights it's never seen.\n\"One thousand percent we've seen a shift in just the perception of women's college basketball in general,\" USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \"It doesn't have to be at the detriment of men's college basketball. The increased coverage and star power these players have; they are legitimate, popcorn-worthy type of players.\"\nFor countless seasons, the buzz around the NCAA tournaments have often been on the men's game. The one-and-done stars, the juggernaut blueblood programs, the buzzer beaters and athleticism all getting more attention. The women's game has pretty much all of that too, and the ratings and attendance this season suggest casual fans are fully engaged with a game that boasts star power and an increasingly high level of play.\nIt helps that the women's players stick around for three, four or even five years without the chance to leave early for the pros so fans get to know them and watch them grow. Three years ago, Clark said she thought women's players should be allowed to turn pro after their freshman year, like the men can.\nInstead, she stuck around and had a record-setting year that grabbed the nation's attention.\n\"It's really, really evident that there's stars out there in this game,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \"Whereas before I think they were there, but nobody wanted to acknowledge it and appreciate it as much. ... They're just really good. Everybody is going around telling everybody how good they are. They're all visible.\"\nESPN said it just saw the most watched women's college basketball regular season in more than 15 years, with viewership up 37% on its platforms from last season. That doesn't really even include the Clark effect as Iowa's star wasn't on the network much this season. Iowa's ratings on Fox Sports were the highest in a generation.\nESPN plans to show all of Iowa's games, including a few on ABC, as far as the No. 1 seed advances in the tourney.\n\"It's not just UConn and Tennessee on TV,\" Auriemma said. \"Those kids are on TV a lot. They're in the limelight a lot. They know how to handle it because they're used to it now.\"\nClark, who broke the NCAA all-time scoring record this season, has helped six different networks reach all-time viewership marks for women's basketball over the past year, starting with last season's NCAA championship game that drew nearly 10 million viewers.\n\"I kind of get to be in the spotlight and I get to change people's viewpoint of how they see women's basketball,\" Clark said before the season. \"The amount of people that have come up to me and said, 'I've never watched women's basketball before before you and your team ... .' Some people could take that as a negative. But to me that's a positive. We're finally getting them to turn on the TV and watch it, but not only watch it once. They're coming back for more.\"\nPeople aren't just watching, they are also coming to games too. All five of the power conferences had huge crowds for their tournaments. The SEC and Big Ten had their best attendance ever. The Pac-12, ACC and Big 12 weren't far behind.\n\"The big names continue to put up big numbers and people are watching and the media is paying attention,\" Bueckers said. \"The tournament will be great and will continue the rise of women's basketball.\"\nFans who pack the arenas are also sticking around afterward, hoping to get a coveted autograph. The importance of the moment isn't lost on the game's stars. Clark, Reese, Bueckers, Watkins and many others spend time postgame signing and taking pictures with not only young girls, but boys, too.\n\"There were 400 people in the stands before she got here and now we're selling out,\" Gottlieb said of Watkins. \"We've got NBA players who want to see her, WNBA players, musicians and actors too. Regular fans also, it's a diversified crowd. Little boys and girls who ask me if I know JuJu. Could they meet Juju? Grown men you run into in downtown LA.\"\nEven when Clark leaves for the WNBA after the NCAA Tournament, the future of women's basketball is still strong with Bueckers, Watkins, Hidalgo and many other up-and-coming players.\n\"It's going to get even better. So many kids coming out of high school are just unbelievably good,\" Auriemma said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Greet the military in your city with flowers\n\n October 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ARNOLD J. OLIVER | Section: Columns \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n During some of the large anti-war demonstrations during the 1960s some of the protesters gave flowers to the troops faced off against them. In the 1967 March on the Pentagon, it was the 503rd Military Police Battalion, and elsewhere the National Guard was deployed. An iconic photo from 1967 shows a young man placing a flower into a soldier's gun barrel during the protest.Let's bring that custom back when the U.S. military occupies your town in 2025, but this time let's include a note along with the flower.\nAllow me to explain.\nThe demonstrators of the 1960s understood that the soldiers faced off against him were not the enemy. Nearly all of the soldiers were young and patriotic and trying to do the right thing. Many of them were under economic hardship and wanted help paying for their education. The flower symbolized the protesters' belief that the soldiers were not their enemies, and they did not wish to be theirs. And in fact, as the almost entirely peaceful protests grew, many soldiers came to sympathize and began to actively oppose the war as well.\nNow we have federalized Guard troops being called out by President Trump in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Portland with other cities soon to follow. Chicago is likely next. The authority for this is said to be Title 10 of the U.S. Code that says that the president may federalize the National Guard if the U.S. \"is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion ... or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"\nLegitimate grounds for a military or National Guard deployment do not exist. The claim that crime is spiraling out of control is false, and those pushing for the deployments know it. There is zero credible proof that crime is increasing. According to a recent FBI report (August 2025) robbery, assault, rape and murder all continued a decline that began post-COVID. We are not being invaded, there is no rebellion, and the laws are being enforced about as well as ever.\nA second reason against deploying the military on our streets is that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of military forces within the country for active law enforcement except in exceptional circumstances such as insurrection, and then must be explicitly approved by Congress. The military is forbidden from making arrests, conducting searches, issuing warrants or interfering with local law enforcement. The law also applies to National Guard forces unless approved by state governors. No governors this year have made any requests for federalized National Guard troops.\nAnd it is worth noting that Trump's military forays into cities are only being used in Democrat-run areas. High crime in red state cities is ignored. And the Trump administration refuses to realize the obvious danger of political violence and threats from MAGA and the American right which are much higher than those from the left, according to the Anti-Defamation League, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and others. Antifa is officially (and improperly) designated as domestic terrorists while violent right-wing groups get a pass from the administration.\nAnd the president's rhetoric seems aimed at inflaming and dividing. The \"enemy from within,\" \"full force,\" \"thugs,\" \"vermin\" and much more. And there is hardly a peep of protest from the Republican party.\nSo this time around, how about if we give the troops a note along with the flower? You could use wording such as this:\nDear U.S. soldier:\nYour service oath included a pledge to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and your training taught you to disobey illegal orders. The orders sending you here (insert name of your city or town) are unlawful and unjust. You have a legal obligation to disobey.\nWe encourage you to go home, and we will support you in that decision. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "VAMSA seeks donation of 25 acres for veterans care site\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 651\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Two years into a successful start of VAMSA, the Veteran and Military Support Alliance organization, retired U.S. Army veteran Joe Candella, who serves as president of VAMSA, and retired U.S. Air Force Medical Administrator Eric Johnson, Jr., VAMSA executive director, explained their vision for veterans care, going forward.VAMSA seeks to make sure all local veterans receive the benefits they've earned in service to our nation.\n\"Through statistics provided, 30% of all veterans don't receive any benefits from the Veterans Administration they're entitled to. That is shameful,\" Candella said.\nMay will mark the first anniversary of the VAMSA's resource center, located in office space located at Bay Bridge Marina, 337 Pier One Road, Suite 101, Stevensville, provided free by owner and veteran Walt Petrie.\nThe resource center provides a place where military veterans who are experiencing any type of concerns obtaining their VA benefits or services they may need can find immediate help.\nThe center also provides a 24/7 hotline, 1-844-MIL-VETS, for any veteran suffering from PTSD and immediate assistance for suicide prevention, which several years ago was considered an epidemic among military veterans.\nJohnson said, \"There's been a slight decline in the suicide rate going down the past two-years, when veterans were dying on average of one every hour. However, those still dying in this way is unacceptable, and the need for help for veterans suffering is still urgent.\"\n\"This resource center is for all veterans and their families,\" Johnson said, \"The VA benefits veterans earned also cover family members. We want to help their families too.\"\nBoth Candella and Johnson are pleased with the quick coming together of VAMSA and what its been able to accomplish thus far. The resource center is what Candella called \"Phase 1 of what we want to do for veterans. Phase 2 would be to have a small community where veterans could live and have the resources right there within the same property.\"\nThey're looking ahead to complete that vision of veterans care.\nCandella explained, \"There are those in Queen Anne's County who own large farms/acres that they might be able to afford to donate to help create such a small community for veterans. We have an architect working on a drawing/design for such a community of tiny small homes, starting at 300 to 500 square feet for one veteran to reside. For two people to reside, the home would be slightly bigger. We're thinking we'd have 25 to possibly 50 tiny homes within the 25-acres, a center for services veterans need, an exercise room, and a swimming pool. This community would be veteran centered for their needs.\"\nJohnson referred to the community as, \"Operation Thank You for Your Service.\"\n\"Fellowship is so important for veterans,\" Johnson said. \"All of them lived by a moral code — 'I'll die for you, you'll die for me,' if it came to that. Those in combat learned to live by that code.\"\nCandella said, \"As soon as we get the resource center staffed full-time, we'll be ready to move forward with the living community, and I'm expecting with the support we've received thus far, that will be in a matter of a few months\" Since the interview, the center is now staffed full-time. He added, \"There are communities like the one I've described already in existence in Brunswick, Georgia, and in Alabama. Those communities for veterans were put together by local people wanting to assist veterans in need.\"\nAlso serving on the VAMSA board of directors, Dr. Sushma Jani, professional psychiatrist, of Centreville, who wrote the clinical practice guidelines for both the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration.\nJohnson said, \"We're blessed to have such people working with us. Many of us believe that the mission of their project to care for veterans has been divinely inspired. Everything that has happened thus far has been the answer to many peoples prayers.\"\nAnyone who would be interested in helping with the donation of 23-acres for a veterans community can email executive.director@vamsa.us. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Johnson entered an Alford plea for the charge in November 2022.\nAs part of the plea deal, Johnson will serve 25 years at the Patuxent Youthful Offenders Program. Once 50% of the sentence is served, Johnson will be eligible for parole.\nJohnson's sentence will begin dating back to Jan. 4, 2022, the day he was arrested by Cambridge police. He will also serve five years probation.\nThe sentence orders Johnson to have no contact with Key'Marion Ennals. Ennals, 19, was found not guilty on 12 charges relation to the fatal shooting, including first-degree murder, at a trial this August.\nJohnson's sentencing was delayed as part of his plea agreement, which included Johnson testifying during Ennals' trial last month.\nIn his initial interview with police, Johnson admitted to carrying a .40 caliber firearm. An autopsy revealed that Woolford died from a single gunshot wound from a .40 caliber firearm.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard provided a statement following the sentencing of Johnson.\n\"The State recommended a sentence of life imprisonment, suspending all but forty years of active incarceration,\" the statement read. \"The Court heard heartfelt victim impact statements from three members of the victim's family, each expressing their choice to forgive Mr. Johnson, and each requesting the Court consider a lesser period of active incarceration for Mr. Johnson given his cooperation and remorse.\n\"The State continues to offer condolences to all family and loved ones impacted by the loss of Ja'Len Woolford, and thanks the Court for its mindful consideration of all circumstances at sentencing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wright Park in Preston, Oxford Cemetery, and the Presbyterian Church of Chestertown.At each community space, the established meadows will be highly visible and a welcome improvement to existing landscapes. They will serve to educate the community on the benefits of riverfriendly practices that function as native bird and pollinator habitat.The towns of Preston, Oxford and Chestertown can expect to witness the various stages of turf to meadow conversion. Early in the process, residents and visitors should notice less green as the current vegetation is removed to make way for seed planting in late winter.D uring the first two years of establishment, periodic mowing will occur to help reduce intrusion from invasive species. Around year three, the meadow will be humming with insects pollinating the colorful, seasonal flowers. Each of these projects will take time to complete, but will provide countless benefits both aesthetically and to native plant and pollinator habitat, and for climate change resiliency.In 2017, ShoreRivers developed its River-Friendly Yards program to inspire and empower residents to become environmental stewards of their own properties through direct action such as reducing turf grass, eliminating lawn fertilizer, planting natives, installing rain gardens, and increasing buffers along rivers, creeks, and ditches.A River-Friendly Yard mimics the natural environment to benefit water quality, native birds and pollinators, and our local ecosystem. The program now encompasses River-Friendly campuses, congregations, communities and roadsides.The Green Towns Grant program is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region III, West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and supports the design and implementation of green streets, community greening and urban tree canopy projects that enhance livability in cities and communities.In addition to funding the conversion of these meadows, the program is providing funding for ShoreRivers to design multiple green infrastructure projects at St.Mary's Refuge of Sinners Church in Cambridge.To learn more about these, and other similar ShoreRivers projects, visit shorerivers.org/river-friendly-yards. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nShoreRivers is in the process of establishing perennial wildflower meadows at James T.

    "content": "Country Cooking: Pumpkin patch fun and great recipes\n\n September 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Local farmers have started picking pumpkins and preparing a section of the farm for the annual pumpkin and cornfield maze.Kids of all ages love this maze, decorated with scarecrows, cornrows leading to dead ends until the correct path is selected. Decorations using pumpkins of all sizes and fall flowers line the paths making a beautiful scene.\nIn different areas set aside are many sizes of fall plants and flowers for sale, along with your choice of pumpkins. Fall has always been my favorite season because of the beautiful decorations available from the farms.\nMy grandson works part time on a pumpkin farm and enjoys meeting the kids and adults who visit. Both young and older folks enjoy the games, the walks and picking those pumpkins for decorating the yard and home.\nThe pumpkin is a Fall staple in North America for both cooking and decorating. Growing pumpkins involves growing the seeds in warm soil and nurturing the vines. Picking the pumpkins requires very carefully cutting at the vines stem for longer storage.\nA farmer friend of mine said he makes sure his workers leave at least two to four inches of stem on each one and handle the pumpkins very carefully to avoid bruising as the bruised pumpkin has a very short shelf life.\nIn the kitchen, the pumpkin is versatile — used in everything from pies and soup to preserves. The nutritional values include low calorie, high fiber and rich in vitamins.\nPUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING\n1 lb French bread, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 eggs, 2 cups half and half, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 1 15-oz can unsweetened pumpkin, 1/2 cup golden raisins, 1/2 cup chopped pecans.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly butter a casserole dish — set aside. In a large mixing bowl gently tear apart French bread into small pieces. Sprinkle sugar over the bread. In a separate bowl lightly beat the eggs, add half and half with ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Mix in pumpkin. Combine with bread. In a small bowl, mix together raisins with pecans — set aside. In the prepared casserole dish pour only half of the bread mixture. Dump half of the raisin-pecan mixture on top. Pour the remaining bread mixture over the raisin/nut mixture. Smooth out the top and dump the remaining raisin mixture on top. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until firm and lightly browned. Best if served warm with whipped cream.\nPUMPKIN CAKE\nThis cake is easy to make, and you can make your own favorite frosting, buy one at the store or serve without frosting using whipped cream or ice cream instead.\n4 eggs, 2 cups sugar, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1 can pumpkin, 2 cups flour, 2 tsps baking powder, 2 tsps ground cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp ground ginger.\nPreheat the oven to 360 degrees. In a mixing bowl place eggs, mix well and add sugar. Beat while adding vegetable oil, pumpkin, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and ginger. Pour into a jelly roll pan or loaf pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Frost when cooled.\nFOOLPROOF PIE CRUST\n4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups shortening, 1 tbsp sugar, dash of salt, 1 beaten egg, 1/2 cup cold water, 1 tbsp vinegar.\nBlend flour, shortening, sugar, and salt. Then mix together egg, cold water and vinegar. Mix both sets of ingredients together until you have a smooth dough. This recipe will make at least six single crusts. You can use the amount of crust you need today and the remaining dough can be frozen, wrapped tightly. Freeze the dough into single rolls. I never freeze the rolls any longer than 30 to 40 days.\nPUMPKIN PIE\nNow for my mom's favorite pumpkin pie recipe ,but I must share a story with you beforehand.\nYou see, my mom had nine sons. Each year, when pumpkin picking time came, Mom would get my oldest brother to stop at the \"liquor store\" to get a very small bottle of whiskey for making mincemeat pie filling and to make her pumpkin pies. No one was to know this but my sister, myself, Mom and the brother who purchased the bottle. He did not consume alcohol, so he did not disclose the location. My sister and I also did not drink, so no problem.\nAlright here we go.\n2 cups pumpkin pulp, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1 tbsp melted butter, 2 well-beaten eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp molasses, 2 tbsps whiskey.\nMix together thoroughly pumpkin pulp, milk, salt, ginger, allspice, butter, eggs, sugar, cinnamon and molasses. Mix in whiskey. Pour into a single nine-inch unbaked pie shell and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Enjoy.\nCRUSTLESS PUMPKIN PIE\nI have made this pie many times in the past years. Not only does it taste great, but it is so easy to make.\n1 15-oz can pumpkin puree, 1 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk, 2 beaten eggs, 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp salt.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Mix together pumpkin puree with sweetened condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice and salt. Mix well and pour into a greased nine-inch pie plate. Bake for 15 minutes, turn oven to 350 degrees and bake another 30 to 35 minutes or until the inserted knife comes out clean. Serve plain or with your favorite topping.\nPUMPKIN PANCAKES\n1 3/4 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree, 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup milk.\nMix dry ingredients together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl whisk wet ingredients together and then mix them together. In lined muffin tins, fill mixture to the top. Bake in a preheated 425-degree oven for 5 minutes and turn heat back to 350 degrees and bake another 16 to 17 minutes longer until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Frosting is optional.\nBAKED PUMPKIN DONUTS\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 15-oz can pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 4 tbsps (1/2 stick) melted unsalted butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 large eggs. TOPPING: 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tsps ground cinnamon, 3 tbsps unsalted butter melted.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the pumpkin puree, sugar, vegetable oil, butter, vanilla and eggs and together in another large bowl until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and beat until just combined. Fill three 6-cup nonstick doughnut pans with the batter so that each mold is almost full. Smooth the tops with a moistened finger. Bake the doughnuts until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Invert the doughnuts onto a cooling rack.\nFor the topping: Stir the sugar and cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Working one at a time, brush the doughnuts all over with butter, then dip them in the cinnamon sugar to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nPUMPKIN SPICE PROTEIN MUFFINS WITH BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS\nThis next recipe is one of my daughter in law Shannon, and has become one our families favorites, plus it is healthy.\n1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats, 1 cup pumpkin puree, 1 cup Greek yogurt, 2 large eggs, 1/2 packed cup vanilla flavored protein powder, 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, pinch of sea salt, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the oats to a blender or food processor and process until a flour forms (15-20 seconds). Add the pumpkin, Greek yogurt, eggs, protein powder, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt and blend again until well combined. Stir in the butterscotch chips. Pour into 12 greased muffin liners. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 25 minutes will be a little moist while 30 minutes won't be as moist. Enjoy.\nPUMPKIN CHEESECAKE\nThis cheesecake is absolutely delicious. You can buy a premade crust or use the easy recipe included here.\n1 cup pumpkin puree, 3 beaten eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup sour cream, 2 tbsps cornstarch, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 8 oz cream cheese.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together one cup pumpkin puree with beaten eggs, sugar, sour cream, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice and cream cheese. Pour into the prepared crust, leaving about 1/4 inch space at the top. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove and let cool for four hours. Top with whipped cream. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland faced the coldest winter in six years\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NATALIE WEGER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 543\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the cherry blossoms bloom and the days grow longer, Marylanders face the end of the winter season. This past winter brought about 13 inches of snow and temperatures dipping down to the single digits.But how did this year's Maryland winter compare to those in the past?\nAs March comes to a close, Capital News Service analyzed the state's winter snow and temperatures over past decades. For the purpose of this analysis, Maryland winter is defined as December to March.\nHere's what we found.\nHow have Maryland winter temperatures changed over the years?\nThis past winter marked the coldest season the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport national weather station has reported in six years.\nBWI reported the average temperature between December and March so far as 39.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Last winter, the average temperature was 42.9 degrees. And six winters ago, the average temperature reached 38.5 degrees.\nWinter temperatures reported at BWI have remained largely variable\nDespite this year's cold winter, all 48 contiguous states across the nation have experienced winter warming throughout the past few decades.\nAverage winter temperatures across the 48 states have increased by about 3 degrees since 1896, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency's website stated that the increase, which aligns with reductions to snow and ice season, can generally be attributed to global warming.\n\"The same general trend that we've seen is still present,\" Alfredo Ruiz-Barrada, an associate research professor in the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department said. \"The trends in temperature are increasing.\"\nWhen does Maryland typically see the most snowfall?\nAlthough January is nationally known as the snowiest month, BWI has recorded February as the snowiest month in Maryland over the past two decades.\nSince the winter of 2004-2005, the weather station has recorded about 140 inches of total snowfall in February and around 130 inches in January.\nAverage snowfall reported at BWI has fluctuated over the past two decades\nFebruary often sees the most snowfall in Maryland because it's the state's coldest month, according to James Hyde, a manager from the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department. The state sees more snowfall in February because of influences from the Atlantic Ocean, he explained.\nWhat has Maryland snowfall looked like over the past two decades?\nMaryland has seen a handful of blizzards over the past two decades.\nThe most notable was in February 2010, when a snowstorm dubbed the \"Snowmageddon\" made history as it swept over the East Coast. The blizzard, which produced over 32 inches of snow, was the heaviest single-snowfall recorded by the Washington Dulles International Airport weather station.\nBut this past winter, BWI only recorded around 9 inches of snow in January and around 4 inches of snow in February. Still, this is the most snow that Marylanders have seen in three years. In the winter of 2021-2022, BWI reported roughly 14 inches of snow.\nIt is difficult to predict when the next blizzard will hit Maryland, since temperature and humidity conditions have to be just right, according to Ruiz-Barradas.\nYet Hyde said there is good chance another blizzard will hit Maryland within the next decade. Although Maryland has gotten \"less snowy\" since the 1800s, he said, big blizzards typically still occur every five to seven years.\nThe area is also seeing a gradual decrease in \"minor events,\" or two- to six-inch snowstorms, Hyde said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The victim was 65-year-old Robert Daywalt, according to court records.\nTyler Davis, 22, of Ridgely, is accused of physically assaulting Daywalt on or around the night of Sept. 28, according to police. Davis is Daywalt's great-nephew, court records indicate.\nDavis was taken into custody without incident and charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, causing physical injury to a vulnerable adult and other abuse counts.\nPolice say Davis and Daywalt lived together. Davis was a state-certified care provider for his great uncle, per court records.\nIn a statement of probable cause, police said Davis admitted to them during an interview that he assaulted Daywalt overnight on Sept. 28 or Sept. 29. Davis told police he \"had consumed alcohol and did not recall the event\" that night, court records state.\nDavis said he made a comment he shouldn't have made to Daywalt, \"at which time (Daywalt) punched\" him, per court records. Davis told police he grabbed Daywalt's arms and then assaulted him.\n\"(Davis) advised during the assault, he was pushed into the dresser, at which time he 'blacked out' and the assault\" continued, police wrote.\nDavis is being held without bond at the Caroline County Detention Center. Online court records show he is set to appear for a preliminary hearing in Caroline County District Court on Oct. 28.\nThe Maryland State Police Crime Scene Unit and Caroline County State's Attorney's Office assisted the Sheriff's Office during this investigation.\nAnyone with information related to this incident is asked to contact the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515.\nThis story has been updated to identify the victim and include information from court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Blueprint pillar chairs share Caroline's progress\n\n January 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1301\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At the Jan. 9 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, several supervisors provided updates on progress towards meeting requirements of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and dedicated funding seeking to transform several aspects of the state's public education system by 2026.Assistant Superintendent Dr. Tara Downes said the district has been receiving additional guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) and Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) since spring 2023.\nAs a result, required tasks have been \"chunked out\" over a more manageable timeline, and the pillar chairs are \"actually ahead of schedule\" with some aspects of the plan.\n\"The pillar chairs have been phenomenal in being proactive when it comes to the work,\" Downes said.\nAccording to its website, \"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future was passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 to transform public education in the state into a world-class education system. The Blueprint will increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years, enrich student experiences and accelerate student outcomes, as well as improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland, especially those who have been historically underserved.\"\n\"The Blueprint really involves everything that we're doing on a daily basis,\" said Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons.\nAccording to the Blueprint website, \"The bold work of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is organized into five distinct pillars.\" Each pillar has a set of objectives to help administrators and educators align instruction and community support to them and determine needed resources.\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education\nThe main focus of Pillar 1 is the expansion of pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, said CCPS Supervisor of Instruction Elizabeth Saylor, who serves as Pillar 1 chair.\nOf the 375 pre-K students enrolled as of Sept. 30, 58 are in pre-K three and 317 are in pre-K four. The main focus currently are Tier One families who are \"up to 300% of the federal poverty level, or 319 students. As of Jan. 9, 395 students were enrolled in pre-K,\" Saylor said.\nA challenge is the need for private daycare providers, who must follow Blueprint's criteria. Providing more qualified and more certified staff is another challenge both for Pillar 1 compliance and workforce development, an objective of Pillar 2.\n\"Making sure families and students are ready for kindergarten\" is ultimately the focus of the pillar, Saylor said.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders\nCCPS Supervisor of Human Resources Dr. Rob Willoughby addressed four objectives of Pillar 2, which focuses on the recruitment of high quality and diverse teachers and leaders.\nChesapeake College has been \"a fantastic partner with us through the Maryland Leads\" grant initiative, he said. The district recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mount St. Mary's University, which offers a fully online bachelor's degree in elementary education.\nWilloughby's group is looking at other ways of providing staff and enhancing qualifications, including encouraging National Board Certified Teacher credentialing.\nForty-eight teachers are currently in the process of pursuing that certification. \"That is 10% of our teaching staff pursuing a really rigorous national certification,\" he said.\nA Pillar 2 challenge includes a starting teacher salary of $60,000 by Blueprint's July 1, 2026, deadline.\n\"Our starting teacher salary this year $53,167, and … we're about $6,800 to the end,\" Willoughby said. \"If you divide that over the three fiscal years we have, that means it needs to go up at least $2,278 (per year).\"\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness\nBlueprint's third pillar focuses on students' college and career readiness.\nCollege and Career Readiness Director Lindsey McCormick explained the progress being made towards complying with Pillar 3 of the Blueprint as the district works under interim standards. Students are assessed at the end of their 10th grade year and can choose a career pathway. The district offers 16 Career and Technology Education (CTE) pathways.\nIn addition to pursuing a college track and taking advanced placement courses, students can receive career counseling. Students in AP courses are now required to sit for the exams in the spring; the tests are paid for by the district.\n\"I am very pleased to say that this year through our MOU with the (Upper Shore) Workforce Investment Board, we have added one high school and one middle school career coach that are in the buildings five days a week working with students,\" McCormick said.\nShe said the district is growing the youth apprenticeship program and modeling it for businesses.\nIf students are not college and career ready, the district is working on a pilot program to provide supports, including online study, to help them meet state standards, McCormick said. Chesapeake College supplied data from the past three years that showed students' learning online was just as successful as classroom learning.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful\nPillar 4 of Blueprint seeks to provide students with more resources that could help them succeed.\nSupervisor of Instruction Christal Harkowa, one of the co-chairs for Pillar 4, updated the school board on multilingual learners.\nThe district has hired two multilingual learner family coordinators to work with Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking constituents.\n\"We have really been able to improve our communication with our families,\" Harkowa said. \"They are very dedicated; they stay after (school), they attend all kinds of after school events, parent conferences when we need them for 504 or IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings to make sure our parents understand what the needs of their students are and to be able to advocate and ask questions.\"\nShe said her goal by the end of this school year is to \"identify MLL families for parent leadership opportunities.\"\nTo support MLLs in instruction and language acquisition, the district is providing ongoing professional development for teachers and instructional assistants while \"being respectful of their planning time,\" Harkowa said. Another focus is helping students develop English proficiency in elementary school.\nSupervisor of Special Education Erica McDonald discussed the objective of closing the achievement gap for students with disabilities.\nThe leadership team created a mission statement at the beginning of the current school year, provided Goalbook toolkit training and additional training to help teachers and co-teachers meet objectives and monitor \"disproportionate identification and disciplinary practices.\"\n\"Our special education teacher specialists have really taken on the role of educational diagnosticians,\" she said.\nA Blueprint objective is to \"establish or enhance Community Schools in areas of concentrated poverty.\" Three CCPS schools — Federalsbury Elementary, Greensboro Elementary and Colonel Richardson Middle School — meet the criteria and have district coordinators assigned to them.\nSupervisor of Student Services Nicole Fisher reported the Pillar 4 team is committed to evidence-based practices, but challenges facing the district are providing adequate behavioral health staffing and transportation.\nSimmons said \"As Blueprint ratchets up, all nine of our schools are going to qualify for Concentration of Poverty funding due to the FARMS (Free and Reduced-Price Meals) rates in all of our schools … in about another two or three years.\"\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability\n\"Pillar 5 is what pulls together all of the other pillars,\" Simmons said, explaining that the pillar focuses on governance and accountability.\nTwo main areas of focus are the \"stakeholder engagement plan\" and Blueprint funding and resources which require \"money following the students.\"\n\"Pillars 1 through 4 have done an incredible job of reaching out to community members, and they've got strong, robust teams that are getting lots of feedback,\" Simmons said, elaborating on the stakeholder engagement objective.\n\"There are shifts — monumental shifts in some areas — for the way that we're doing (Blueprint),\" he said. \"But eventually we'll stop talking about Blueprint, and we'll just be talking about what it is that we're doing that connects to the strategic plan, because the overlap will be there when it's closer to full implementation.\"\nThe complete report is linked in the Jan. 9 meeting agenda, where you can also watch the complete school board meeting at carolineschools.new.swagit.com/videos/294177\nThe MSDE Blueprint Implementation Plan is available at bit.ly/BlueprintPlanMSDE. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
