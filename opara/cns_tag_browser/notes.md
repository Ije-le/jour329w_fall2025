CNS_tag_browser     9/29/2025

LESSONS LEARNED FROM QUERIES
The queries return information on the tag name and how many times it's been used. The tags are case sensitive, and some of the information returned are repetitive, because some are in upper case and others are in lower case. So while a tag might have a count of 10, there is the possibility it has been used more times than that. Example: "CNS TV" and "cnstv."

PLANNING TAG BROWSER
How would someone want to search through 1000+ tags?:
    A person would do this by typing the tag name they are searching for in a search bar.
What information should be displayed prominently?:
    After the search, the tag name should be displayed prominently, along with the count like it does in the terminal. This can be immediately followed by the first few stories in which these tags were used.
How should the tags be sorted by default?:
    The tags should be sorted alphabetically.
What filters might be useful?:
    Filtering by the beats covered by the newsroom might help. So if a user is searching for "Donald Trump" tag in connection to a health story, it might help to filter your search down to the health beat rather than looking through everything that has that tag in it.
                           FEATURE WISHLIST
A search bar
An option to filter by beats
Arrows below search results that let users skip to other pages, like with Google. Since results will be returned alphabetically, this will help with finding results further down.
                        BUILDLING WITH COPILOT
My first prompt asked for a user-friendly webpage that has a search bar and a list of tags showing the tag name and count. I asked for the pagination buttons below as well and different documents for CSS and Javascript. Copilot produced a pretty basic webpage with barely any colors. It looked more like a table of tags, so I followed up with a prompt directing Copilot to include colors, and a filter bar in which newsroom beats would be listed alphabetically. I also directed Copilot to include a preview of two stories for each tag. I wasnt sure how this would work, since we have no data for stories. But I wanted to see how Copilot would handle this. My thought was that I would have empty links that can be updated later under each tag, but Copilot produced previews using the summarization of the stories, where available (I didn't realize these existed at first because they are not available for all tags). Where there were no summarizations, it did not include anything other than the tag name and count. To make everything look more uniform, I asked Copilot to include "Preview to be added soon" under each tag. It did.
A quick look through the webpage showed that everything was working just fine, but the search bar for the tags was quite limiting because users had to know exactly what tags they were looking for and type that in before they could find anything, so I followed up with a prompt asking Copilot to return a search bar that doubled as a drop down option. That way, a user could simply scroll through the list of tags and decide which to choose.
I was not too impressed with the way the webpage looked because though it now had more colors, it still looked like a table. I asked for each tag to be put in its own container rather than a single container. I wanted different fonts for the previev message. I also wanted the tags to take up more space. At first, I ran this prompt and it didnt work. The next time, it did, but presented a distorted webpage, so I asked it to revert to what it was before.
                             REFLECTIONS
What surprised me in the coourse of buildng this webpage is the Copilot's prosctiveness in substituting story preview with summaries. I was happy with it for this exercise,  but also conscious of the fact that this can play out differently if I really didn't want the summarizations there. But it all still boils down to prompts, because asking for stories when I knew I hadn't given Copilot anything to work with is essentially giving it leeway to do what it liked.
Still on prompts, I had better output when I knew exactly what I wanted and how to describe it. An example is in the case of paginations. At the beginning of the exercise, I couldn't recall the word 'paginations,' so I tried as best as I could to describe it and gave examples with Google. I recalled the word when I looked at the css file and saw it. This was also oone of the most frustratting parts of the assignment, because when I couldn't describe the white container hosting the search bar, filter and tags, it was difficult to make the webpage look the way I wanted. The webpage suddenly had containers going out of proportion and i had to just take what I got.
I also didn't like that when I leave codespaces for a while and return to it, the webpage refused to show up, unless I run the 'uv python...' code again.

Ije-le: Hello

GitHub Copilot: Hello! How can I assist you with your project today?

Ije-le: Create a file called tesst.html using Ijeoma Opara as the header. Use the blink tag for this and serve it through a simple Pyhton server.

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/tesst.html)

Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

The file tesst.html has been created with "Ijeoma Opara" as a blinking header. A simple Python server is now running on port 8000 to serve this file. You can view it by navigating to http://localhost:8000/tesst.html in your browser. 

Let me know if you need anything else!

Made changes.

Ije-le: In the cns_tag_browser under Opara directory, create a file called index.html

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/opara/cns_tag_browser/index.html)

The file `index.html` has been created in the cns_tag_browser directory. Let me know if you want to add any specific content or features to this page!

Made changes.

Ije-le: Using tags.json under data directory as your data source, update the index.html file, creating a webpage that displays the CNS tags in a user-friendly way. Let the webpage have a search bar through which users can search and find the tags from tags.json. The webpage should have the list of tags displayed prominently in alphabetical order with the count. At the bottom of the website, include buttons with page numbers and arrows pointing left and right, which allows users scroll faster to the end of the tags. Please make this webpage have different CSS and Javascript documents.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The `index.html` file in cns_tag_browser has been updated to display the CNS tags from tags.json in a user-friendly, searchable, and paginated format. The CSS (`styles.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files are separated for maintainability.

You can now open `index.html` in a browser to view and interact with the tag browser. Let me know if you need further customization or help serving the page!

Ije-le: Serve this through a simple Python server

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

The Python HTTP server is now running on port 8000. You can view your tag browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/opara/cns_tag_browser/index.html in your browser. Let me know if you need anything else!

Ije-le: Now, update the files to include a filter at the top. Let users be able to filter through the tags using a drop down button that provides a list of beats covered. The beats include: Politics, Health, Crime, Community and Lifestyle. By using the filter button, users get only tages used under these beats. Arrange the beats alphabetically in the drop down. Under each tag, create a preview for at least two stories pubished using the tag. Use the following hex codes to add a bit of color to the webpage, while still making use of whate space: #f5b342 #f55742

I have the required context from your data files. Hereâ€™s the plan for the next steps:

1. Update the JavaScript to:
   - Filter tags by the selected beat (using a mapping of tags to beats, since the data does not directly provide this).
   - Show at least two story previews under each tag, using story_summaries.json.
2. Update the CSS to use the provided color scheme and style the new elements.
3. Ensure the dropdown and previews are visually appealing and functional.

I will proceed with the JavaScript update for beat filtering and tag previews next.

Ije-le: serve this in a simple Python server

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

The Python server could not start because port 8000 is already in use. You can either stop the existing server or use a different port (e.g., 8001). Would you like me to start the server on another port?
