CNS_tag_browser     9/29/2025

LESSONS LEARNED FROM QUERIES
The queries return information on the tag name and how many times it's been used. The tags are case sensitive, and some of the information returned are repetitive, because some are in upper case and others are in lower case. So while a tag might have a count of 10, there is the possibility it has been used more times than that. Example: "CNS TV" and "cnstv."

PLANNING TAG BROWSER
How would someone want to search through 1000+ tags?:
    A person would do this by typing the tag name they are searching for in a search bar.
What information should be displayed prominently?:
    After the search, the tag name should be displayed prominently, along with the count like it does in the terminal. This can be immediately followed by the first few stories in which these tags were used.
How should the tags be sorted by default?:
    The tags should be sorted alphabetically.
What filters might be useful?:
    Filtering by the beats covered by the newsroom might help. So if a user is searching for "Donald Trump" tag in connection to a health story, it might help to filter your search down to the health beat rather than looking through everything that has that tag in it.
                           FEATURE WISHLIST
A search bar
An option to filter by beats
Arrows below search results that let users skip to other pages, like with Google. Since results will be returned alphabetically, this will help with finding results further down.
                        BUILDLING WITH COPILOT
My first prompt asked for a user-friendly webpage that has a search bar and a list of tags showing the tag name and count. I asked for the pagination buttons below as well and different documents for CSS and Javascript. Copilot produced a pretty basic webpage with barely any colors. It looked more like a table of tags, so I followed up with a prompt directing Copilot to include colors, and a filter bar in which newsroom beats would be listed alphabetically. I also directed Copilot to include a preview of two stories for each tag. I wasnt sure how this would work, since we have no data for stories. But I wanted to see how Copilot would handle this. My thought was that I would have empty links that can be updated later under each tag, but Copilot produced previews using the summarization of the stories, where available (I didn't realize these existed at first because they are not available for all tags). Where there were no summarizations, it did not include anything other than the tag name and count. To make everything look more uniform, I asked Copilot to include "Preview to be added soon" under each tag. It did.
A quick look through the webpage showed that everything was working just fine, but the search bar for the tags was quite limiting because users had to know exactly what tags they were looking for and type that in before they could find anything, so I followed up with a prompt asking Copilot to return a search bar that doubled as a drop down option. That way, a user could simply scroll through the list of tags and decide which to choose.
I was not too impressed with the way the webpage looked because though it now had more colors, it still looked like a table. I asked for each tag to be put in its own container rather than a single container. I wanted different fonts for the previev message. I also wanted the tags to take up more space. At first, I ran this prompt and it didnt work. The next time, it did, but presented a distorted webpage, so I asked it to revert to what it was before.
Then I started working on the random tags. At first it worked fine. i had asked that the random tags change on their own every minute and this worked, but didn't render in a way that appealed to me. No colors, no style of any kind. So I tried to style it, but my prompts didn't lead to any changes:
    No, you did not update your codes to reflect these changes. Please, update the select tag buttons to have the same width as the filter button. Again, give the "Show Randon Tag" button the same width, size and color as the Filter button.
I also inclluded the comapre tags feature. That came two select tags buttons (Select tag1 and select tag2) and one compare button. Then I added the similar tags feature which also came with a select tag feature. At this point, things seemed to take a downward spiral because Copilot now began to take orders from itself. For instance, it seemed like the positions of the 'compare tags' feature I added was interefering with the 'show random tag' button closeby, because that magically just stopped showing random tags. I tried to move the random tag and filter button into the masthead, but then I suddenly got two mastheads! I didnt ask for that. I also noticed that with every new prompt I gave, a new update came up on the webpage that I did not ask for. Like the tags going from being inside a container that was right in the middle of the webpage to being in containers that spread across the web page while the tags themselves moved to the left of the screen. Somehow, after a few more prompts, including one in which I yelled, I managed to get rid of the second masthead. I also moved the similar tags feature to the bottom of the screen. The pagination button wouldn't let me see it clearly, so I tried to update that with the most basic prompt. Didn't work.
I made a last attempt with: Reduce the length containers for the tags to make room for the the 'Find Similar Tags' feature on  the webpage. Move the pagination to the lowest part of the webpage too. I also repeated the prompt for finding similar tags, because that button randomly stopped working.
No show. Instead, all my tags suddenly disappeared. I also started to get frequent notifications that my webpage was unresponsive.
My Copilot was flying this plane without another pilot that wasn't me. I returned the containers to the length they were before I made the last attempt and moved on.
                             REFLECTIONS
What surprised me in the coourse of buildng this webpage is the Copilot's prosctiveness in substituting story preview with summaries. I was happy with it for this exercise,  but also conscious of the fact that this can play out differently if I really didn't want the summarizations there. But it all still boils down to prompts, because asking for stories when I knew I hadn't given Copilot anything to work with is essentially giving it leeway to do what it liked.
Still on prompts, I had better output when I knew exactly what I wanted and how to describe it. An example is in the case of paginations. At the beginning of the exercise, I couldn't recall the word 'paginations,' so I tried as best as I could to describe it and gave examples with Google. I recalled the word when I looked at the css file and saw it. This was also oone of the most frustratting parts of the assignment, because when I couldn't describe the white container hosting the search bar, filter and tags, it was difficult to make the webpage look the way I wanted. The webpage suddenly had containers going out of proportion and i had to just take what I got. I also didn't like that when I leave codespaces for a while and return to it, the webpage refused to show up even though Copilot tells me i can see it if I refresh, unless I run the 'uv python...' code again.
Until the end of the assignment, things were quite cool between Copilot and I, and the only problems were mostly from things I couldn't describe, but by the time I started to try for the extra credit, Copilot seemed to have had enough of me.
I got a lot of push back in this section. At first the random button tag worked, but then, it stopped working suddenly after I tried to move things around on the webpage. My only guess is that some of the updates were conflicting with existing ones. At some point, It seemed that trying to update one button affected the way another button rendered. Almost like the positioning might be conflicting with the position of other tags somehow. I couldn't figure out why exactly, but I tried to . But I figured out a different problem, which is that I had too many selct tags buttons on the webpage (select tag, select tag 1 select tag 2) and when I gave prompts for the actual select tag button in my head, I didn't specify its name and the command I was giving just applied to any of the three.

Ije-le: Now, update the files to include a filter at the top. Let users be able to filter through the tags using a drop down button that provides a list of beats covered. The beats include: Politics, Health, Crime, Community and Lifestyle. By using the filter button, users get only tages used under these beats. Arrange the beats alphabetically in the drop down. Under each tag, create a preview for at least two stories pubished using the tag. Use the following hex codes to add a bit of color to the webpage, while still making use of whate space: #f5b342 #f55742

I have the required context from your data files. Here’s the plan for the next steps:

1. Update the JavaScript to:
   - Filter tags by the selected beat (using a mapping of tags to beats, since the data does not directly provide this).
   - Show at least two story previews under each tag, using story_summaries.json.
2. Update the CSS to use the provided color scheme and style the new elements.
3. Ensure the dropdown and previews are visually appealing and functional.

I will proceed with the JavaScript update for beat filtering and tag previews next.
