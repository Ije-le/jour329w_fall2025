## CNS Datasette Analysis

## What was the most interesting thing you saw doing this?
The most interesting thing for me is how we could group similar items together using tags or keywords. Without manually reading through stories in a data  set, I could easily find all the stories talking about the same thing at once. I like how easy this makes the search process of searching and grouping. 

## What was the most useful thing you saw doing this?
I think the most useful way to use Datasette is finding patterns.

## How useful was Datasette for this kind of analysis?
I think that Datasette was very useful for this analysis. Although it might have some limitations (I'm not sure how one can update data sets in Datasette), but based on already existing datasets, I think it is very useful.

## What would you use this tool for in a newsroom?
In a newsroom, I would likely use Datasette to share data sets with other reporters like we discussed in class. Beyond just sharing, I think it would be a very useful tool for exploring data sets, searching out patterns or outliers, thereby generating story ideas.

## How does this compare to analyzing data in other tools?
One way that Dattasette compares to analyzing data in other tools like R is that there is limited amount of coding especially from other parties who might have need to explore the data set.
